You can upgrade or downgrade your Java service to a different major Java version by setting the <a href="/java/how-to/build-pipeline#base-1">`run.base`</a> parameter in your `zerops.yml`. When you [trigger a new pipeline](/java/how-to/trigger-pipeline), Zerops will start new runtime container(s) with the required Java version. If you don't specify the `run.base` attribute in your `zerops.yml`, Zerops keeps the current Java version for your runtime.

If you want to build your application with a different major Java version, change the <a href="/java/how-to/build-pipeline#base">`build.base`</a> parameter in your `zerops.yml`. The `build.base` is the required attribute.
