Zerops provides a fully managed [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) columnar database optimized for blazing-fast analytical queries on massive datasets, making it ideal for data warehousing and real-time analytics applications.

## Supported Versions

Currently supported ClickHouse version:
<UnorderedList data={data.clickhouse.readable}/>

Import configuration version:
<UnorderedCodeList data={data.clickhouse.import}/>

## Service Configuration

Our ClickHouse implementation features optimized default settings designed for analytical workloads and data warehousing use cases.

### Resource Allocation

Zerops automatically allocates resources to your ClickHouse service based on demand within the limits defined in your [automatic scaling configuration](/features/automatic-scaling).

## High Availability and Deployment Modes

:::important
Deployment mode is selected during service creation and cannot be changed later.
:::

### High-Availability (HA) Setup

The recommended solution for production workloads and mission-critical analytics:

* **3 data nodes** with automatic monitoring, repairs, and replication factor of 3
* **Default cluster name:** `zerops` (currently 1 shard with 3 replicas)

#### Replication Configuration

The `Replicated` database engine handles replication automatically, but there are specific requirements you need to follow:

**For Database Operations**
Use this configuration when creating/managing databases:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE uk ON CLUSTER '{cluster}'
ENGINE = Replicated('/clickhouse/databases/{uuid}', '{shard}', '{replica}');
```

**For Table Operations**
Use `ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree` when creating tables (without the `ON CLUSTER '{cluster}'` clause):

```sql
CREATE TABLE uk.uk_price_paid
(
    price     UInt32,
    date      Date,
    postcode1 LowCardinality(String),
    postcode2 LowCardinality(String),
    type      Enum8('terraced' = 1, 'semi-detached' = 2, 'detached' = 3, 'flat' = 4, 'other' = 0),
    is_new    UInt8,
    duration  Enum8('freehold' = 1, 'leasehold' = 2, 'unknown' = 0),
    addr1     String,
    addr2     String,
    street    LowCardinality(String),
    locality  LowCardinality(String),
    town      LowCardinality(String),
    district  LowCardinality(String),
    county    LowCardinality(String)
) ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree ORDER BY (postcode1, postcode2, addr1, addr2);
```

For more details see:
- https://clickhouse.com/docs/engines/database-engines/replicated
- https://clickhouse.com/docs/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replication
- https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/distributed-ddl

You can use other `Replicated*` engines from the MergeTree family. Replication is only supported for tables in the MergeTree family:

* `ReplicatedMergeTree`
* `ReplicatedSummingMergeTree`
* `ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree`
* `ReplicatedAggregatingMergeTree`
* `ReplicatedCollapsingMergeTree`
* `ReplicatedVersionedCollapsingMergeTree`
* `ReplicatedGraphiteMergeTree`

User management (users, grants, etc.) is replicated by Keeper by default. The `ON CLUSTER '{cluster}'` clause is not needed when creating/deleting users or changing grants.

The default `<service-hostname>` database follows these practices. If you don't follow these recommendations, it is possible you will face issues in case of fail and repair scenario.

### Single Container Installation

Suitable for development and testing environments:

* Consists of 1 ClickHouse node
* Lower resource requirements
* No automatic replication

:::warning
Use for development purposes or non-critical data only. **Make sure to have backups enabled** if using in production, as you can lose your data due to container volatility.
:::

## Network Access & Protocols

Zerops automatically configures secure authentication for your ClickHouse service.

### Default Database
Zerops creates a default database with the same name as your service hostname (`<service-hostname>`) during service creation.

### Default Users

#### `zerops` User
* Created automatically upon service creation
* Has privileges for the default database
* Password available as environment variable `password`

#### `super` User
* Administrative user for cluster management
* Can create new databases, users, and manage permissions
* Password available as environment variable `superUserPassword`

### Access Methods

Services within the same project can access ClickHouse directly using:
```
<service-hostname>:<port>
```

For HA cluster setups, you can also access specific data nodes:
```
node-stable-<1..3>.db.<service-hostname>.zerops:<port>
```

For external access, use `zcli` VPN to connect using the same connection strings.

ClickHouse offers multiple interfaces for different use cases:

#### Native TCP Protocol
**Port:** `9000` (Environment variable: `port` or `portNative`)

Optimal for high-performance applications and ClickHouse-native clients.

More about it in [official ClickHouse docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/tcp).

#### HTTP/HTTPS Interface
**Port:** `8123` (Environment variable: `portHttp`)

Ideal for web applications and REST API integrations.

It is also possible to setup HTTPS domain access or enable subdomain for access from outside the project. Then you can access the database using following URL:
- `https://clickhouse.my-awesome-domain.tld`
- JDBC connection string example (use `ssl=true&sslmode=NONE` options):
`jdbc:clickhouse:https://clickhouse.my-awesome-domain.tld:443/?ssl=true&sslmode=NONE`

More about it in [official ClickHouse docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/http).

#### MySQL Protocol
**Port:** `9004` (Environment variable: `portMysql`)

Enables connectivity from MySQL-compatible tools and applications.

More about it in [official ClickHouse docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/mysql).

#### PostgreSQL Protocol
**Port:** `9005` (Environment variable: `portPostgresql`)

Allows integration with PostgreSQL-compatible clients and ORMs.

More about it in [official ClickHouse docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/postgresql).

## Backup and Recovery

Zerops provides comprehensive backup functionality using ClickHouse's native backup capabilities.

### Backup Process

* Backups are performed using ClickHouse SQL command `BACKUP ALL ...` with `super` user permissions
* All databases are backed up (excluding system databases)
* Backup files are stored as `tar.gz` archives
* Contains the complete folder structure produced by the SQL backup command

### Restore Options

#### Option 1: Custom S3 Bucket Restore

1. Download backup from Zerops GUI or via API
2. Extract the tar.gz archive and upload to your S3 bucket
3. Restore using ClickHouse SQL commands:

```sql
-- Restore specific table
RESTORE TABLE mydb.mytable AS mydb.mytable2
FROM S3('https://storage-prg1.zerops.io/mybucket/path/to/dir/with/untarred/backup',
        'my-access-key-id', 'my-secret-key');

-- Restore all data
RESTORE ALL FROM S3('https://storage-prg1.zerops.io/mybucket/path/to/backup',
                   'my-access-key-id', 'my-secret-key');

-- see https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/backup#configuring-backuprestore-to-use-an-s3-endpoint
```

#### Option 2: Support-Assisted Restore

Contact Zerops support on Discord, and we'll place the backup on the container's filesystem for restoration using the `File` driver (see [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/backup) for further info).

:::note
A simple GUI/API action for backup restoration is on our roadmap for future releases.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Problems
* Verify you're using the correct port for your chosen protocol
* Check that your service is running and healthy in the Zerops dashboard
* For HA clusters, try connecting to specific nodes if the main endpoint fails
* Ensure authentication credentials are correct

#### Replication Issues
* Verify you're using `ON CLUSTER '{cluster}'` for database operations
* Confirm tables use `ReplicatedMergeTree` engines
