You can upgrade or downgrade your Gleam service to a different major Gleam version by setting the <a href="/gleam/how-to/build-pipeline#base-1">`run.base`</a> parameter in your `zerops.yaml`. When you [trigger a new pipeline](/gleam/how-to/trigger-pipeline), Zerops will start new runtime container(s) with the required Gleam version. If you don't specify the `run.base` attribute in your `zerops.yaml`, Zerops keeps the current Gleam version for your runtime.

If you want to build your application with a different major Gleam version, change the <a href="/gleam/how-to/build-pipeline#base">`build.base`</a> parameter in your `zerops.yaml`. The `build.base` is the required attribute.
