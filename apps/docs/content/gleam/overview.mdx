[Gleam â†—](https://gleam.org/en) is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, which is designed to build scalable network applications.

As said, there is no need for coding yet, we have created a [Github repository â†—](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-gleam), a **_recipe_**, containing the most simple Gleam web application. The repo will be used as a source from which the app will be built.

<CustomCard title="Feel free to deploy the recipe yourself" emoji="ðŸš€">
  This is the most bare-bones example of Gleam app running on Zerops â€” as few libraries as possible,
  just a simple endpoint with connect, read and write to a Zerops PostgreSQL database.

1. Log in/sign up to [Zerops GUI â†—](https://app.zerops.io)


2. In the **Projects** box click on **Import a project** and paste in the following YAML config ([source â†—](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-gleam/blob/main/zerops-project-import.yaml)):

```yaml
project:
  name: recipe-gleam
  tags:
    - zerops-recipe

services:
  - hostname: api
    type: gleam@1.5
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
    buildFromGit: https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-gleam

  - hostname: db
    type: postgresql@16
    mode: NON_HA
    priority: 1
```

3. Click on **Import project** and wait until all pipelines have finished.

**That's it, your application is now up and running! :star: Let's check it works:**

1. A _subdomain_ should have been enabled and visible in the project's **IP addressed & Public Routing Overview** box. Its format should look similar to this `https://api-808-3000.prg1.zerops.app`.
2. Click or the `subdomain` URL to open it in a browser and you should see

```
{"message":"This is a simple Gleam application running on Zerops.io, each request adds an entry to the PostgreSQL database and returns a count. See the source repository (https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-gleam) for more information.","newEntry":"e64be640-d6c2-4be8-93ac-d1e40e56fa06","count":1}
```
