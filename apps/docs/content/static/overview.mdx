## Quick Start

Add a Static service to your project by including this in your `zerops.yaml`:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
zerops:
  - setup: app
    run:
      os: alpine
      base: static
```

## Default Behavior

Every Static service in Zerops comes with built-in defaults optimized for modern web applications, including Single Page Applications. By default, for any incoming request, the service will:
1. Try to serve the exact path (`$uri`)
2. Try with .html extension (`$uri.html`)
3. Look for an index.html in the directory (`$uri/index.html`)
4. Fall back to `/index.html` (suitable for SPAs)
5. Return 404 if none of the above exist

:::important SPAs
Single Page Applications work out of the box without any additional configuration. The built-in fallback to `/index.html` ensures that client-side routing functions properly.
:::

## Routing Configuration

The Static service allows you to configure additional URL routing and redirects through simple YAML configuration, abstracting away the complexity of Nginx configuration.

### Custom Routing Configuration

Configure custom routing beyond the default behavior in the `run.routing` section of your `zerops.yaml`:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
run:
  routing:
    redirects:
      # Only needed for custom redirect scenarios
      - from: /special-path/*
        to: /specific-landing-page
        status: 302
```

### Redirect Types

#### Relative Redirects

:::note
Remember that SPA routing is already built into the default behavior. You don't need to add any custom redirects for client-side routing to work.
:::

Use relative redirects to route paths within your application. When both `from` and `to` are relative paths, you can omit the `status` code to create a masked redirect that shows the content of the target page while preserving the original URL:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
routing:
  redirects:
    # Masked redirect - URL stays the same but shows content from about-us
    - from: /about
      to: /about-us

    # Standard redirect with status code
    - from: /old-page
      to: /new-page
      status: 301

    # Preserve the path when redirecting between directories
    - from: /blog/*
      to: /articles/
      preservePath: true
      status: 302

    # Preserve both path and query parameters
    - from: /posts/*
      to: /blog/
      preservePath: true
      preserveQuery: true
      status: 302
```

:::caution Important
When using `preservePath` with wildcards, ensure the `to` path ends with a `/` to maintain proper path concatenation. For example, `/blog/*` to `/new-blog/` will correctly redirect `/blog/hello.html` to `/new-blog/hello.html`, while `/new-blog` would result in `/new-bloghello.html`.
:::

#### Absolute Redirects

For redirecting between domains or to external URLs, use absolute redirects by including `http://` or `https://`. When using absolute URLs in either `from` or `to`, you must specify a `status` code:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
routing:
  redirects:
    # Redirect an old domain to a new one
    - from: https://old-domain.com/*
      to: https://new-domain.com
      status: 301
      preserveQuery: true  # Optional: maintain query parameters

    # Redirect with path preservation
    - from: https://old-site.com/*
      to: https://new-site.com/
      status: 301
      preservePath: true
```

### Advanced Routing Features

#### Wildcard Matching

Use `*` as a wildcard in your paths:
- **At the end of a path**: Matches any subsequent content
- **At the start of a domain** (after `https://`): Enables regex matching for subdomains

Example of domain management:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
run:
  routing:
    redirects:
      # Redirect a specific domain to an article
      - from: https://promo-domain.com/*
        to: https://main-site.com/special-offer
        status: 302

      # Redirect all subdomains to main site
      - from: https://*.old-domain.com/*
        to: https://main-site.com
        status: 302
```

#### Matching Priority

When multiple redirects are configured, they follow Nginx's matching priority system:

1. Exact matches are checked first
2. Simple path matches (without wildcards) are checked next
3. Pattern matches (with wildcards) are checked last

For example:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
routing:
  redirects:
    # Exact match for homepage - standard redirect
    - from: /
      to: /home
      status: 302

    # Simple path match - masked redirect
    - from: /about
      to: /about-us

    # Pattern match with path preservation
    - from: /blog/*
      to: /articles/
      preservePath: true
      status: 302
```

In this configuration:
- `/` will redirect to `/home` with a 302 status
- `/about` will show content from `/about-us` but keep the URL as `/about`
- `/blog/post-123.html` will redirect to `/articles/post-123.html`
- Any other path will use the [default behavior](#default-behavior)

### CORS Configuration

You can enable CORS for your static service by adding a `cors` directive:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
run:
  routing:
    # Simple case - automatically converted to '*'
    cors: "*"

    # Full syntax with proper quoting
    cors: "'*' always"
```

The `cors` directive sets the following headers:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
- `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`

:::note
The `cors` directive has a special case: if you specify just `"*"`, it's automatically converted to `'*'`. For any other values, you need to include the proper Nginx syntax including quotes.
:::

### Custom Headers

For more control over HTTP headers, use the `headers` directive:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
run:
  routing:
    headers:
      - for: "/"
        values:
          # All values need proper quoting since they're inserted directly into Nginx
          X-Frame-Options: "'DENY'"

          # Values with internal quotes need proper YAML escaping
          Content-Security-Policy: '"default-src ''self''"'
```

:::important
Header values are inserted directly into the Nginx configuration **without** additional quotes, which means:

1. **All values must include their own quotes** (typically single quotes)
2. If you need single quotes inside your header value, you must escape them in YAML (using double single quotes)
3. To include the `always` directive, add it after your quoted value
4. For complex values, you can use YAML's block scalar notation (`>-`) for better readability
:::

Here are examples for different header scenarios:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
headers:
  - for: "/"
    values:
      # Simple header with proper quoting
      X-Frame-Options: "'DENY'"

      # Header with 'always' directive
      X-XSS-Protection: "'1; mode=block' always"

      # Header with internal single quotes - need double single quotes for escaping
      Content-Security-Policy: '"default-src ''self'' https://cdn.example.com"'

      # Complex header with block scalar notation for better readability
      Content-Security-Policy: >-
        "default-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com;
        script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
        img-src * data:" always
```

When this configuration is processed, it translates to the following Nginx directives:

```
add_header X-Frame-Options 'DENY';
add_header X-XSS-Protection '1; mode=block' always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com";
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * data:" always;
```

:::important Path Handling
When you specify headers for a path that doesn't have an existing location block, the Static service automatically creates a location with the same [default behavior](#default-behavior) as the root path (trying files in order: `$uri`, `$uri.html`, `$uri/index.html`, `/index.html` or returning 404).

If you add headers for a path that already has a location block, your headers will be merged with the existing configuration.
:::

### Combining CORS and Custom Headers

You can use both CORS and custom headers together:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
run:
  routing:
    cors: "'*' always"
    headers:
      - for: "/"
        values:
          X-Frame-Options: "'DENY'"
```

The `cors` directive sets default Access-Control headers for all routes, while the `headers` directive allows you to set additional headers for specific paths.

:::important
If you specify Access-Control headers in the `headers` directive, they will override the ones set by `cors` for that specific path.
:::

## Prerender Integration

The Static service includes built-in support for Prerender.io for server-side rendering for search engines and social media crawlers.

### Basic Prerender Setup

1. Set the `PRERENDER_TOKEN` secret variable with your Prerender.io token
2. The service automatically configures necessary rewrites based on user agents

### Custom Prerender Host

If you're using a custom Prerender host, add it to environment variables in `zerops.yaml`:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
run:
  envVariables:
  - PRERENDER_HOST=your.prerender.host
```

:::note Default
The default host is `service.prerender.io` if not specified.
:::

## Advanced Configuration

### Switching to Full Nginx

If you need more control over your Nginx configuration:

1. Go to your Static service overview in the UI
2. Click the three vertical dots in the left panel
3. Select **Need to switch to full Nginx service?**
4. Copy the generated Nginx configuration
5. Use this configuration as a starting point for a full Nginx service

:::tip
This allows you to move to a more customizable setup while maintaining your existing routing logic.
:::

## Best Practices

1. **Domain Migration**
   ```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
   routing:
     redirects:
       - from: https://old-domain.com/*
         to: https://new-domain.com
         status: 301
   ```
   Use permanent (301) redirects when permanently moving content to maintain SEO value.

2. **Complex Redirects**
   ```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
   routing:
     redirects:
       - from: /specific-path/*
         to: /specific-landing
         status: 302
       # Additional specific redirects go here
   ```

3. **Security Headers**
   Add security headers to protect your application:
   ```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
   routing:
     headers:
       - for: "/*"
         values:
           X-Frame-Options: "'DENY'"
           X-Content-Type-Options: "'nosniff'"
           # Note the proper quoting for values with single quotes
           Content-Security-Policy: '"default-src ''self''"'
   ```

## Frontend Framework Integration

The Static service works with modern frontend frameworks. It can serve built static files from any framework with options for custom routing and Prerender.io integration if needed.

### Example: Analog App Deployment

Here's a configuration for deploying an [Analog application](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-analog-static):

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - pnpm i
        - pnpm build
      deployFiles:
        - dist/analog/public/~
    run:
      base: static
```

This configuration:
1. Uses Node.js 20 for building the application
2. Installs dependencies with pnpm
3. Builds the application
4. Deploys the resulting static files to the Static service

You can enhance this basic setup with:
- Custom redirects for URL management
- Prerender.io integration for SEO
- Additional routing rules as needed

## Common Configurations

### Multiple Domain Management
```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
run:
  routing:
    redirects:
      # Product-specific domain
      - from: https://product-promo.com/*
        to: https://main-site.com/products
        status: 302

      # Campaign domain
      - from: https://special-offer.com/*
        to: https://main-site.com/campaign
        status: 302

      # Legacy domains and subdomains
      - from: https://*.legacy-domain.com/*
        to: https://main-site.com
        status: 302
```

### Development Setup
```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
run:
  routing:
    # CORS with proper quoting
    cors: "'*' always"
    redirects:
      # API requests
      - from: /api/*
        to: https://api.your-domain.com
        status: 302
```

### Security-Enhanced Configuration
```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
run:
  routing:
    headers:
      # Custom headers for default location
      - for: "/*"
        values:
          X-Frame-Options: "'DENY' always"
          X-Content-Type-Options: "'nosniff' always"
          # Note the proper escaping of single quotes
          Content-Security-Policy: '"default-src ''self''" always'
```
