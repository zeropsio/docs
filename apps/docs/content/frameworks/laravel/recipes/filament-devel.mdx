[Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) is a collection of tools for rapidly building beautiful TALL stack (Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel, Livewire) applications. It provides a powerful admin panel, form builder, table builder, and other components that help you build feature-rich web applications with minimal effort.

This recipe demonstrates how to effectively integrate Laravel Filament applications with Zerops, providing a fully production-capable setup. While this setup is built for professional deployment, we call it a **development environment** due to its streamlined resource allocation and use of the [Lightweight](/features/infrastructure#project-core) core package, optimizing costs without compromising functionality.

## Environment Overview

Your newly deployed Laravel Filament environment includes:

- A fully configured Laravel application service with Filament installed
- PostgreSQL database integration with migration automation
- Automated build and deployment pipeline
- Health and readiness checks
- Configured Filament admin panel and components

:::note
For production environments with high-availability services and enterprise-grade reliability, consider deploying the [production environment recipe](/frameworks/laravel/recipes/minimal-prod).
:::

## Application Configuration

The app has been set up to utilize PostgreSQL service and includes Filament's admin panel and components. Your application's deployment process is managed through [zerops.yaml](/zerops-yaml/specification), which handles:

- Database migrations
- Cache management
- File cleanup
- Health check implementation
- Service orchestration
- Filament assets compilation

## Try the build & deploy pipeline in 30 seconds

While Zerops supports various CI/CD workflows (CLI, GitHub Actions, built-in CI/CD), let's start with the simplest path to get you familiar with the core concepts:

1. Create your own repository from our [GitHub template](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-minimal) and clone it locally
2. Navigate to **Pipelines & CI/CD settings** and connect the service with your new GitHub repository, setting the trigger to **Push to Branch**

### Test Your Pipeline

- Make a small change directly in the GitHub UI
- Commit the change and watch the magic happen in project detail

## Integration with Existing Applications

If you're looking to integrate an existing Laravel Filament application with Zerops, review the [changes made over the default installation](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-minimal/blob/main/README.md#changes-made-over-the-default-installation) to understand the necessary modifications.
