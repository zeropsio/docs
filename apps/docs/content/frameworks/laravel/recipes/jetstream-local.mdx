Laravel Jetstream provides a polished application scaffolding for Laravel, featuring authentication, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via Laravel Sanctum, and optional team management features. It serves as the perfect starting point for your next Laravel application.

This recipe provides a comprehensive Laravel Jetstream setup with PostgreSQL database, Redis-compatible store, object storage, and automated deployment pipeline, designed for **local development** with cost-efficient resource allocation and the [Lightweight](/features/infrastructure#project-core) core package. This means:
- Resources are optimized for development workloads
- Services can be started/stopped as needed during active development
- Cost-effective configuration suitable for development and testing

## Environment Overview

Your newly deployed Laravel Jetstream environment includes:

- A fully configured Laravel application service with Jetstream
- PostgreSQL database integration with migration automation
- Valkey (Redis-compatible KV store) for sessions and cache
- Built-in object storage for filesystem
- Mailpit for development SMTP server
- Automated build and deployment pipeline
- Health and readiness checks

:::note
For production environments with high-availability services and enterprise-grade reliability, consider deploying the [production environment recipe](/frameworks/laravel/recipes/jetstream-prod).

## What to Expect

The deployment process takes just a few minutes. Once complete, you'll receive:

- A live URL to access your application
- Database credentials
- Access to your project dashboard
- CLI configuration details for VPN access

## Setting Up Local Development

Zerops provides a built-in VPN feature through its CLI tool, enabling seamless local development against remote resources. Here's how to set it up:

### Prerequisites
- Install the [Zerops CLI](/references/cli#get-started) and log in with [personal access token](/references/cli#personal-access-tokens)
- Install [Wireguard](/references/vpn) on your system

### Setup Steps

1. Create your own repository from our [GitHub template](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-jetstream) and clone it locally

2. **Configure VPN Access**
   ```bash
   # Initialize VPN connection using project ID
   zcli vpn up <project-id>

   # Or use interactive mode to select your project
   zcli vpn up
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create and configure environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Fill in database access details - in Zerops GUI go to the detail of `db` service and open **Access details** in the left menu.

   ```bash
   composer install
   php artisan key:generate
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve # or use your preferred setup (Valet, Herd, Sail)
   ```

Your local environment is now connected to the Zerops infrastructure, utilizing the database, redis and storage from Zerops while maintaining local development flexibility.

## Application Configuration

The app has been set up to utilize:
- Valkey (Redis-compatible KV store) to handle sessions and cache
- Built-in S3 object storage for Laravel and Jetstream-specific filesystem operations
- Mailpit as a mock SMTP server for development purposes

Your application's deployment process is managed through [zerops.yaml](/zerops-yaml/specification), which handles:

- Database migrations
- Cache management
- File cleanup
- Health check implementation
- Service orchestration

## Try the Build & Deploy Pipeline

Now that you're logged into zcli, deploying your application is straightforward. Simply enter `zcli push` in your terminal from the root of your freshly cloned project.

### Test Your Pipeline

The best way to verify your setup is with a quick test:
- Make a small change directly in the GitHub UI
- Commit the change and watch the magic happen in your project dashboard

### Setting Up Automated CI/CD

To enable automatic deployments:

1. Navigate to **Pipelines & CI/CD settings** in your service dashboard
2. Connect the service with your new GitHub repository
3. Set the trigger to **Push to Branch**

## Integration with Existing Applications

If you're looking to integrate an existing Laravel Jetstream application with Zerops, review the [changes made over the default installation](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-jetstream/blob/main/README.md#changes-made-over-the-default-installation) to understand the necessary modifications.
