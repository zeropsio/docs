[Twill](https://twillcms.com/) is a flexible CMS toolkit for Laravel that helps you rapidly create a custom administration interface for your application. It provides a robust set of features including content management, media library, block editor, and a powerful publishing workflow system.

This recipe demonstrates how to effectively integrate Laravel Twill applications with Zerops, providing a fully production-capable setup. While this setup is built for professional deployment, we call it a **development environment** due to its streamlined resource allocation and use of the [Lightweight](/features/pricing#understanding-projects) core package, optimizing costs without compromising functionality.

## Environment Overview

Your newly deployed Laravel Twill environment includes:

- A fully configured Laravel application service with Twill CMS installed
- PostgreSQL database integration with migration automation
- Automated build and deployment pipeline
- Health and readiness checks
- Configured Twill admin interface and media library

:::note
For production environments with high-availability services and enterprise-grade reliability, consider deploying the [production environment recipe](/frameworks/laravel/recipes/minimal-prod).

## Application Configuration

The app has been set up to utilize PostgreSQL service and includes Twill's CMS functionality. Your application's deployment process is managed through [zerops.yml](/zerops-yml/specification), which handles:

- Database migrations
- Cache management
- File cleanup
- Health check implementation
- Service orchestration
- Twill assets compilation
- Media storage configuration

## Try the build & deploy pipeline in 30 seconds

While Zerops supports various CI/CD workflows (CLI, GitHub Actions, built-in CI/CD), let's start with the simplest path to get you familiar with the core concepts:

1. Create your own repository from our [GitHub template](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-minimal) and clone it locally
2. Navigate to **Pipelines & CI/CD settings** and connect the service with your new GitHub repository, setting the trigger to **Push to Branch**

### Test Your Pipeline

- Make a small change directly in the GitHub UI
- Commit the change and watch the magic happen in project detail

## Integration with Existing Applications

If you're looking to integrate an existing Laravel Twill application with Zerops, review the [changes made over the default installation](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-minimal/blob/main/README.md#changes-made-over-the-default-installation) to understand the necessary modifications.
