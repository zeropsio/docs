[Twill](https://twillcms.com/) is a flexible CMS toolkit for Laravel that helps you rapidly create a custom administration interface for your application. It provides a robust set of features including content management, media library, block editor, and a powerful publishing workflow system.

This recipe demonstrates how to effectively integrate Laravel Twill applications with Zerops, providing a fully production-grade setup. It's built as a **production environment** with high-availability configuration and uses the [Serious](/features/infrastructure#project-core-options) core package, ensuring enterprise-grade reliability and robust performance.

## Environment Overview

Your newly deployed Laravel Twill environment includes:

- A fully configured Laravel application service with Twill CMS installed and high availability
- PostgreSQL database integration with migration automation
- Automated build and deployment pipeline
- Health and readiness checks
- Configured Twill admin interface and media library

:::note
For development environments with cost-efficient resource allocation, consider deploying the [development environment recipe](/frameworks/laravel/recipes/minimal-devel).

## Application Configuration

The app has been set up to utilize PostgreSQL service and includes Twill's CMS functionality. Your application's deployment process is managed through [zerops.yaml](/zerops-yaml/specification), which handles:

- Database migrations
- Cache management
- File cleanup
- Health check implementation
- Service orchestration
- Twill assets compilation
- Media storage configuration

## Try the build & deploy pipeline in 30 seconds

While Zerops supports various CI/CD workflows (CLI, GitHub Actions, built-in CI/CD), let's start with the simplest path to get you familiar with the core concepts:

1. Create your own repository from our [GitHub template](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-minimal) and clone it locally
2. Navigate to **Pipelines & CI/CD settings** and connect the service with your new GitHub repository, setting the trigger to **Push to Branch**

### Test Your Pipeline

- Make a small change directly in the GitHub UI
- Commit the change and watch the magic happen in project detail

## Integration with Existing Applications

If you're looking to integrate an existing Laravel Twill application with Zerops, review the [changes made over the default installation](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-minimal/blob/main/README.md#changes-made-over-the-default-installation) to understand the necessary modifications.
