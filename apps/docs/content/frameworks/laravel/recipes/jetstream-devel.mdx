Laravel Jetstream provides a polished application scaffolding for Laravel, featuring authentication, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via Laravel Sanctum, and optional team management features. It serves as the perfect starting point for your next Laravel application.

This recipe demonstrates how to effectively integrate Laravel Jetstream applications with Zerops, providing a fully production-capable setup. While this setup is built for professional deployment, we call it a **development environment** due to its streamlined resource allocation and use of the [Lightweight](/features/infrastructure#project-core-options) core package, optimizing costs without compromising functionality.

## Environment Overview

Your newly deployed Laravel Jetstream environment includes:

- A fully configured Laravel application service with Jetstream installed
- PostgreSQL database integration with migration automation
- Automated build and deployment pipeline
- Health and readiness checks
- Configured Jetstream authentication system

:::note
For production environments with high-availability services and enterprise-grade reliability, consider deploying the [production environment recipe](/frameworks/laravel/recipes/minimal-prod).

## Application Configuration

The app has been set up to utilize PostgreSQL service and includes Jetstream's authentication scaffolding. Your application's deployment process is managed through [zerops.yaml](/zerops-yaml/specification), which handles:

- Database migrations
- Cache management
- File cleanup
- Health check implementation
- Service orchestration
- Jetstream assets compilation

## Try the build & deploy pipeline in 30 seconds

While Zerops supports various CI/CD workflows (CLI, GitHub Actions, built-in CI/CD), let's start with the simplest path to get you familiar with the core concepts:

1. Create your own repository from our [GitHub template](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-minimal) and clone it locally
2. Navigate to **Pipelines & CI/CD settings** and connect the service with your new GitHub repository, setting the trigger to **Push to Branch**

### Test Your Pipeline

- Make a small change directly in the GitHub UI
- Commit the change and watch the magic happen in project detail

## Integration with Existing Applications

If you're looking to integrate an existing Laravel Jetstream application with Zerops, review the [changes made over the default installation](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-minimal/blob/main/README.md#changes-made-over-the-default-installation) to understand the necessary modifications.
