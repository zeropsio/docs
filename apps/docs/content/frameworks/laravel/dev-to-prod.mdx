description: Going from Development to Production for Laravel on Zerops
---

Zerops offers two core packages for Laravel projects: Lightweight for development and Serious for production environments.

## Development Environment

For development and small-scale projects, use the Lightweight package. It runs on a single container instead of 5 different containers, making it ideal for development environments.

Create a development project using:

```yml
project:
  name: laravel-development
  tags:
    - zerops-recipe
    - development
```

### Lightweight Package Features

- Single container architecture
- 100 hours of build time on performant build containers
- 5 GB space for automatic, encrypted backups
- 1 TB of egress
- No Horizontal Scaling

## Production Environment

For production deployments and larger projects, use the Serious package. Create a production project using:

```yml
project:
  name: laravel-production
  corePackage: SERIOUS
  tags:
    - zerops-recipe
    - production
```

### Serious Package Features

- Highly available core services (L3 balancer with firewall, logger, statistics service)
- Highly available HTTP routing & load balancer with SSL termination and automatic certificate generation
- Proxy / load balancers for managed services
- Unique IPv6 IP address
- 150 hours of build time on performant build containers
- 25 GB space for automatic, encrypted backups
- 3 TB of egress
