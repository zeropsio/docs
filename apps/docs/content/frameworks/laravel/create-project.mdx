Creating a project in Zerops is the first step to deploying your Laravel application where you can also add different services to use with your Laravel application.

You can create a project using either the Zerops GUI or [zCLI](/references/cli).

<Image

  darkImage="/img/gui/create-project.png"
  alt="Create a Zerops project"
  style={{ width: '95%', height: 'auto' }}
/>


Zerops offers two core packages for Zerops projects: Lightweight for small scale projects and development and Serious for production environments.

## Small Scale Projects

For development or small-scale projects, use the Lightweight Core Package. You can create a project by importing the following Yaml:

```yml
project:
  name: laravel-development
  # You don't need to specify the corePackage, it's set to LIGHTWEIGHT by default
  corePackage: LIGHTWEIGHT
  tags:
    - zerops-recipe
    - development
```

### Lightweight Package Features

- Single container architecture
- 100 hours of build time on performant build containers
- 5 GB space for automatic, encrypted backups
- 1 TB of egress

## Larger Scale Projects

For production deployments or larger projects, use the Serious Core Package. You can create a project by importing the following Yaml:

```yml
project:
  name: laravel-production
  # You need to specify the corePackage as SERIOUS as it's default as LIGHTWEIGHT
  corePackage: SERIOUS
  tags:
    - zerops-recipe
    - production
```

### Serious Package Features

- Highly available core services (L3 balancer with firewall, logger, statistics service)
- Highly available HTTP routing & load balancer with SSL termination and automatic certificate generation
- Proxy / load balancers for managed services
- Unique IPv6 IP address
- 150 hours of build time on performant build containers
- 25 GB space for automatic, encrypted backups
- 3 TB of egress


As you've created a Zerops Project, you can [create a Php Nginx service](/frameworks/laravel/create-service) for your Laravel application.
