## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy a Laravel application on Zerops. We'll configure a complete environment using Apache as the web server and PostgreSQL as the database.

By using Zerops' built-in VPN functionality, you’ll be able to securely connect to your PostgreSQL database directly from your local environment without needing to install PostgreSQL locally. This setup allows you to use your favorite database tools and perform Laravel migrations while working with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Zerops.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:
- Have a fresh Laravel installation running locally
- Set up a Zerops project with Apache and PostgreSQL
- Configure zero-downtime deployment with environment variables
- Deploy a production-ready Laravel application accessible via a Zerops subdomain
- Set up secure VPN access to your PostgreSQL database

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes you have:
* PHP, Composer, git installed on your machine
* [Zerops account](https://app.zerops.io/signup)

:::tip
New Zerops accounts receive $15 in free credits for testing. After verifying your account with a $10 initial payment, you'll get an additional $50 in credits.
:::

## Step 1 — Creating a New Laravel Project

Let's start by creating a fresh Laravel project:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel zerops-laravel
cd zerops-laravel
```

:::note
Instead of setting up a local database, we'll later configure your local Laravel to connect directly to the PostgreSQL database in Zerops through a secure VPN connection.
:::

Now, let's verify everything works locally. Start Laravel's development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser. You should see Laravel's welcome page.

:::tip
While we're using Laravel's built-in server for simplicity, you can use any local development setup you prefer (Valet, Sail, XAMPP, etc.).
:::

If you see the welcome page, great! Your local setup is working correctly.

## Step 2 — Setting Up Your Zerops Project

### Setting up zcli

First, we'll need the Zerops Command Line Interface (zcli). Follow this article to [install and log into zcli](/references/cli) with your **Personal access token**.

### Creating Project Configuration

When you create a project in Zerops, you're getting much more than just a collection of services. Let's look at what happens behind the scenes and how to configure it.

#### Production-Ready Infrastructure and Network Security

When you create a project in Zerops, you get a production-grade infrastructure that eliminates common development headaches. Avoid the 'it works on my machine' issues – your team will develop in environments identical to production.

Each project runs in its own isolated network with enterprise-level security features automatically configured:
- A smart load balancer handles traffic distribution and security
- Every service gets automatic SSL/TLS certificate management
- Internal services communicate securely using simple hostnames (like 'db' or 'app')
- The entire infrastructure is accessible through a secure VPN

What makes this special is how it combines security with simplicity. You can:
- Connect to your databases from local tools with full security
- Let team members access services without complex firewall rules
- Run local development against production-identical services
- Deploy changes knowing they'll work exactly as they did in development

Best of all, this infrastructure requires zero configuration from you – it's all handled automatically when you create your project. You can learn more about infrastructure features in documentation section [Project & Services Structure](https://docs.zerops.io/features/infrastructure).

#### Project Configuration File

Let's create our project definition in YAML. This approach provides clear, reproducible infrastructure configuration that can be version controlled. Later in this tutorial, we'll also show how to achieve the same using the GUI.

Create a new file in your project root called `zerops-project-import.yml` with the following content:

```yaml title="zerops-project-import.yml"
#yamlPreprocessor=on
project:
  name: laravel-zerops
  tags:
    - zerops-tutorial # tag for easy filtering (optional)

services:
  - hostname: app
    type: php-apache@8.4
    envSecrets:
      # yamlPreprocessor feat: generates a random 32 char and stores it
      APP_KEY: <@generateRandomString(<32>)>

  - hostname: db
    type: postgresql@16
    mode: HA  # High Availability mode for robust production setup
```

:::note
The `#yamlPreprocessor=on` directive enables Zerops' [YAML preprocessing](/references/importyml/pre-processor) for this import file, allowing us to use dynamic values and built-in functions like `generateRandomString`.
:::

#### Automatic Resource Management

One of Zerops' most powerful features is its [intelligent autoscaling system](/features/scaling-ha). You don't need to specify fixed resource allocations because Zerops automatically:
- Scales resources (CPU, RAM, Disk) up and down based on actual usage
- Maintains minimum required resources to optimize costs
- Handles vertical and horizontal scaling automatically
- Manages disk space dynamically (a unique feature in the industry)

See current ranges for [horizontal](/php/how-to/scaling#horizontal-auto-scaling) and [vertical](/php/how-to/scaling#vertical-auto-scaling) scaling of PHP services.

#### High-Availability Database

By setting `mode: HA` for the PostgreSQL service, we get:
- A database cluster distributed across ***3 physical servers***
- Automatic failover and data replication
- Enhanced performance through load distribution
- Production-grade reliability

Through Zerops VPN, you can securely access this database setup directly from your local machine, ensuring your development environment matches production exactly.

Configuring a production-grade HA database cluster usually demands DevOps expertise for replication, failover, and load balancing. With Zerops, this is automated and you get this enterprise-level setup automatically. This means you can develop against the same robust database infrastructure that you'll use in production, eliminating environment discrepancies and ensuring your code works consistently across all stages of development.

Now create the project by running:
```bash
zcli project project-import zerops-project-import.yml
```
:::tip Team Collaboration Tip
This declarative approach to infrastructure configuration provides significant advantages for team development:
- New team members can quickly create identical development environments
- Infrastructure configuration is transparent and easily reviewable
- Setup is deterministic and reproducible across all environments
- Changes to infrastructure can be version-controlled alongside your code
:::

### Alternative: Creating Project via GUI

You can also create and configure your project through the Zerops dashboard:

1. Log into your [Zerops Dashboard](https://app.zerops.io)
2. Click **Add new project**
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "laravel-zerops") and click **Create project**

Then add the required services:

1. **PHP + Apache Service:**
   - Click **Add Service** and select **PHP+Apache**
   - Set hostname to "app"
   - Keep all other settings as default

2. **PostgreSQL Service:**
   - Click **Add Service** and select **PostgreSQL**
   - Set hostname to "db"
   - Keep all other settings as default

## Step 3 — Configuring Your Application

Create a `zerops.yml` configuration file in your project root:

```yaml title="zerops.yml"
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base:
        - php@8.4
      buildCommands:
        - composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
      deployFiles: ./
      cache:
        - vendor
        - composer.lock
    deploy:
      readinessCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /up
    run:
      base: php-apache@8.4
      envVariables:
        APP_NAME: "Laravel Zerops Demo"
        APP_DEBUG: false
        APP_ENV: production
        APP_URL: ${zeropsSubdomain}
        DB_CONNECTION: pgsql
        DB_HOST: db
        DB_PORT: 5432
        DB_DATABASE: db
        DB_USERNAME: ${db_user}
        DB_PASSWORD: ${db_password}
        LOG_CHANNEL: stack
        LOG_LEVEL: debug
        SESSION_DRIVER: database

      initCommands:
        - php artisan config:cache
        - php artisan route:cache
        - sudo -E -u zerops -- zsc execOnce ${appVersionId} -- php artisan migrate --force
        - php artisan optimize
      healthCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /up
```

Let's break down some important parts of this configuration:

### Health Checks

The health check configuration ensures your application is running correctly:
```yaml
    readinessCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /up
    ...
    healthCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /up
```

Zerops uses these health checks to:
- Verify new deployments before routing traffic (readinessCheck)
- Monitor running containers (healthCheck)
- Automatically restart unhealthy containers
- Ensure zero-downtime deployments

By default, latest version of Laravel responds with a 200 OK status on the `/up` endpoint, so no additional configuration is needed.

### Environment Variables

Zerops provides several built-in variables that you can use in your configuration:

```yaml
APP_URL: ${zeropsSubdomain}  # Automatically set to your app's Zerops URL
DB_USERNAME: ${db_user}      # Database credentials auto-injected
DB_PASSWORD: ${db_password}  # Securely managed by Zerops
```

These values are automatically injected by Zerops:
- `${zeropsSubdomain}` - Your application's Zerops URL
- `${db_user}` and `${db_password}` - Secure database credentials

Learn more about [environment variables](/features/env-variables) in Zerops.

### Safe Database Migrations
```yaml
sudo -E -u zerops -- zsc execOnce ${appVersionId} -- php artisan migrate --force
```
This special command ensures your database migrations run exactly once, even when running multiple containers. It's crucial for preventing duplicate migrations during scaling.


## Step 4 — Deploying Your Application

Now comes the exciting part - deploying your application to Zerops!

### Deploying Your Code

Initialize git in your project directory:
```bash
git init
```

:::note
Git is required to track changes for deployment. You don't need to commit but initializing git helps Zerops manage the deployment files.
:::

Push your code to Zerops:
```bash
zcli push
```

You'll go through an interactive selection process:

1. First, you'll see a list of your projects:
```
Please, select a project
| ID                       | NAME                | ORG NAME              | STATUS |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| jrkERI7FTrZn7jwcTnACCA   | laravel-zerops      | ORGANIZATION_NAME     | ACTIVE |
```
Select your project from the list.

2. Then, you'll select the service:
```
INFO    Selected project: laravel-zerops
SELECT  Please, select a service

| ID                       | NAME    | STATUS |
|--------------------------|---------|--------|
| 7pinFB1ZSIeGz16OIi4GuQ   | app     | ACTIVE |
| cD2fDBetS0KPQAcIsnH8OA   | db      | ACTIVE |
```
Select the "app" service.

3. The deployment will proceed with output like:
```
INFO    Selected project: laravel-zerops
INFO    Selected service: app
INFO    creating package
INFO    File zerops.yml found. Path: /path/to/zerops.yml
DONE    package uploaded
INFO    package created
INFO    deploying service
DONE    Push finished
```

### Monitoring the Deployment

1. Go to the [Zerops Dashboard](https://app.zerops.io)
2. In the top-left corner, you'll see a circle with **running process** text
3. Click it to see the build progress overview
4. Click **Open pipeline detail** button to view the detailed build process

You'll see the deployment progress with timing for each step:
- Initializing build container
- Running build commands from zerops.yml
- Creating app version and upgrading PHP+Apache service

The entire process usually takes less than a minute to complete.

## Step 5 — Verifying Your Deployment

Once the deployment completes, let's verify everything works:

1. Go to your project's app service
2. Click on **Public access & internal ports**
3. Find the **Public Access through zerops.app Subdomain** section
4. Toggle **Enable Zerops Subdomain Access**
5. Click the generated URL (e.g., https://app-xxx.prg1.zerops.app) to view your application

:::note
The Zerops subdomain is perfect for testing and development, but for production, you should set up your own domain under **Public Access through Your Domains**. See [detailed guide](/features/access) about public access.
:::

### Testing Database Connectivity

Let's create a quick route to test database connectivity. Add this to your `routes/web.php`:

```php
Route::get('/db-test', function () {
    session()->save();
    return 'Current number of active sessions in database: ' . Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB::table('sessions')->count();
});
```

Deploy this change:
```bash
zcli push
```

Visit your-app-url/db-test to verify database connectivity.

## Accessing Your Database Locally

Once your application is deployed, you might want to access the database directly from your local machine. Zerops makes this easy with VPN access.

### Setting up VPN Access

1. Start the VPN connection:
```bash
zcli vpn up
```

:::note
Now you can access your services directly with hostname. Try http://app.zerops/ to verify connectivity.
:::

2. Select your project when prompted

That's it! You now have direct access to all services in your project.

### Connecting to Database

To get your database credentials:
1. Go to the PostgreSQL service in your project
2. Click **Access details** button
3. Here you'll find all connection details including hostname, port, user, and password

Update your local `.env` file with these credentials:

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=db.zerops
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=db
DB_USERNAME=db
DB_PASSWORD=[password from Access details]
```

Now you can use your favorite database management tool or run artisan commands while working with the database in Zerops - no local PostgreSQL installation needed!

## Next Steps

Now that your Laravel application is running on Zerops, consider:

1. Setting up a custom domain
2. Implementing basic CI/CD pipelines implementing [GitHub](https://docs.zerops.io/references/github-integration) or [GitLab](https://docs.zerops.io/references/gitlab-integration) integration
3. Setting up [object storage](https://docs.zerops.io/object-storage/overview)

## Conclusion

Congratulations! 🎉 You've successfully deployed a Laravel application on Zerops with Apache and PostgreSQL. Your application is now running in a production-ready environment with automated builds and deployments.
