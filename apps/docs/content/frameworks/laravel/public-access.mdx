### Enabling Public Access while importing project

The `enableSubdomainAccess: true` option automatically enables public access to the project after it's successfully imported and deployed.

```yaml
project:
  name: laravel-minimal-devel

services:
  - hostname: app
    type: php-nginx@8.4
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
```


### Public access from Zerops Subdomain

Project subdomain is available for public access.

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base:
        - php@8.4
      os: alpine
    deploy:
      readinessCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /up
    run:
      base: php-nginx@8.4
      os: alpine
      healthCheck:
        httpGet:
