Zerops manages environment variables without requiring manual `.env` files, enabling application deployment across different environments (development, staging, production) while keeping environment-specific configurations isolated from your code.

## Laravel Environment Variables in Zerops

### Secret Variables
Some Laravel variables contain sensitive information that should never be exposed as plain text. Manage these using Zerops Secret Variables by:
* Creating and managing them through the Zerops GUI
* Defining them in a configuration file when importing a project or service (allows [automatic generation](#automatic-generation-during-import))

When importing a project or service, you can define secret variables directly in your import configuration:
```yaml
services:
  - hostname: app
    type: php-nginx@8.4
    envSecrets:
      APP_KEY: your-secret-key
```

:::tip
Secret variables can be updated at any time without requiring application redeployment.
:::

#### Automatic Generation During Import
If you prefer to have certain secrets **generated automatically**, you can use the [yaml preprocessor](/references/import-yaml/pre-processor). This is optional and only available during import:
```yaml
#yamlPreprocessor=on
services:
  - hostname: app
    type: php-nginx@8.4
    envSecrets:
      APP_KEY: <@generateRandomString(<32>)>
```

### Runtime Variables
These variables, defined in `zerops.yaml`, are typically environment-specific but not sensitive.
:::note
Changes to runtime variables require application redeployment to take effect.

Below is a complete working example of `envVariables` in `zerops.yaml` (sourced from [Laravel Jetstream recipe](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-jetstream/blob/main/zerops.yaml)):

Let's look at variable configurations that may need additional context and where to find detailed implementation guides:

#### Application Configuration
Core application settings that define your Laravel app's identity, URL structure, and environment parameters. Reference environment variables from the same service.
```yaml
APP_URL: ${zeropsSubdomain} # zeropsSubdomain variable is system generated
ASSET_URL: ${APP_URL}
VITE_APP_NAME: ${APP_NAME} # APP_NAME variable was created during import (envSecrets)
```

#### Database Configuration
Essential database connection parameters that securely reference your PostgreSQL service `db` by hostname and its variables - `password` and `user`.

It is safe to store `DB_PASSWORD` in `envVariables` by reference as it does not contain the sensitive value itself.

```yaml
DB_HOST: db
DB_PASSWORD: ${db_password}
DB_USERNAME: ${db_user}
```
Read more about [database management](/frameworks/laravel/migrations) for Laravel in Zerops.

#### Storage Configuration
S3-compatible object storage settings that enable efficient file handling and asset management in your Laravel application. Reference variables of Object storage service called `storage`.
```yaml
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${storage_accessKeyId}
AWS_REGION: us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET: ${storage_bucketName}
AWS_ENDPOINT: ${storage_apiUrl}
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${storage_secretAccessKey}
AWS_URL: ${storage_apiUrl}/${storage_bucketName}
AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT: true
FILESYSTEM_DISK: s3
```

#### Logging Configuration
System monitoring and debugging configuration that determines how your application tracks events and errors. Use `syslog` channel to access logs from Zerops Dashboard.
```
LOG_CHANNEL: syslog
```

#### Mail Configuration
SMTP server settings that enable your application to send emails through a dedicated mail service. Reference service `mailpit` by hostname.
```
MAIL_HOST: mailpit
```
Learn how to properly [configure SMTP](/frameworks/laravel/smtp) for Laravel in Zerops.

#### Cache and Session
Redis-based configuration for handling application caching, queues, and session management to optimize performance. Reference service `valkey` by hostname.
```
REDIS_HOST: valkey
```
Learn how to properly [configure cache, queue & session management](/frameworks/laravel/redis) for Laravel in Zerops.

:::tip
For automatic execution with each deploy, add these commands to the `initCommands` section of your `zerops.yaml` file.

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
initCommands:
  - php artisan view:cache
  - php artisan config:cache
  - php artisan route:cache
```
