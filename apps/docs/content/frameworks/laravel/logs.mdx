---

Zerops provides comprehensive logging capabilities for your Laravel application through three different log types:

- [build log](#build-log)
- [prepare runtime log](#prepare-runtime-log)
- [runtime log](#runtime-log)

## How to access logs

### Build log

#### Zerops GUI

To access a build log in Zerops GUI:
1. Go to the service detail
2. Choose **Service dashboard & runtime containers** in the left menu
3. Open the pipeline detail of an application version 
4. Click on **Build log**

The build log button is available only if the [build pipeline](/frameworks/laravel/deployment) was triggered for the selected deploy.

#### zCLI

To access a build log in Zerops CLI use:

```sh
zcli service log --showBuildLogs
```

Read more about the [zcli service log](/references/cli/access-logs) command.

### Prepare runtime log

#### Zerops GUI

To access a prepare runtime log in Zerops GUI:
1. Go to the service detail 
2. Choose **Service dashboard & runtime containers** in the left menu
3. Open the pipeline detail of an application version
4. Click on **Prepare runtime log**

The prepare runtime log button is available only if the [prepare runtime pipeline](/frameworks/laravel/deployment#prepare-runtime) was triggered for the selected deploy.

#### zCLI

_Prepare runtime log is currently not supported in zCLI._

### Runtime log

#### Zerops GUI

To access a runtime log in Zerops GUI:
1. Go to the service detail
2. Choose **Runtime log** in the left menu

  />
</p>

Each runtime container has its own log. If your service has multiple containers, select the container in the log header.

You can filter log records by:
- Minimum severity level
- Time period

#### zCLI

To access the log of the runtime containers in Zerops CLI use:

```sh
zcli service log
```

## Laravel Logging Configuration

Zerops logs all messages sent to:
- Standard error (`stderr`)
- Standard output (`stdout`) 
- Laravel's logging system

### Configure Laravel Logging

To configure Laravel to use syslog for Zerops:

```php:config/logging.php
'channels' => [
    'stack' => [
        'driver' => 'stack',
        'channels' => ['syslog'],
    ],
    
    'syslog' => [
        'driver' => 'syslog',
        'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'debug'),
    ],
],
```

### Severity Levels

Laravel log levels are automatically mapped to syslog severity levels:

```php
// Emergency (0) - System is unusable
Log::emergency('System is down');

// Alert (1) - Action must be taken immediately  
Log::alert('Database connection lost');

// Critical (2) - Critical conditions
Log::critical('Application component unavailable');

// Error (3) - Error conditions
Log::error('Unable to process request');

// Warning (4) - Warning conditions
Log::warning('Invalid input received');

// Notice (5) - Normal but significant condition
Log::notice('User logged in');

// Info (6) - Informational messages
Log::info('Request processed successfully');

// Debug (7) - Debug-level messages
Log::debug('Query executed in 50ms');
```

:::tip
Use appropriate log levels to make it easier to filter and find relevant log messages in Zerops GUI.
