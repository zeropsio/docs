title: Scheduled Tasks and CRON Jobs
description: Learn how to configure and manage scheduled tasks in your Zerops Laravel applications using CRON
---

Zerops provides a convenient way for managing scheduled tasks through CRON jobs, configured directly in your `zerops.yml` file. These tasks can be scheduled to run on single or multiple containers with granular timing control.

## Basic Configuration

Cron jobs are defined in the `run.crontab` section of your `zerops.yml`. Each job requires two essential parameters:
- **command**: The command to execute
- **timing**: The CRON schedule expression

```yaml
run: 
  crontab:
    - command: "date >> /var/log/cron.log"
      timing: "0 * * * *"
```

This example logs the current timestamp every hour.

## Common Implementation Patterns
### Laravel Scheduler
To run Laravel's scheduler, configure it to execute every minute:

```yaml
run: 
  crontab:
    - command: "php artisan schedule:run"
      timing: "* * * * *"
      workingDir: /var/www/html
```

### Cleanup Tasks
Execute maintenance tasks on all containers:

```yaml
run: 
  crontab:
    - command: "rm -rf /tmp/*"
      timing: "0 0 * * *"
      allContainers: true
```

### Multiple Jobs
Configure multiple scheduled tasks within a single service:

```yaml
run:
  crontab:
    - command: "php artisan schedule:run"
      timing: "* * * * *"
      workingDir: /var/www/html
    
    - command: "php artisan cache:clear"
      timing: "0 0 * * *"
      workingDir: /var/www/html
      
    - command: "php artisan queue:restart"
      timing: "0 */6 * * *"
      workingDir: /var/www/html
```

## Best Practices

1. **Log Output**: Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring:
   ```yaml
   command: "php artisan schedule:run >> /var/log/scheduler.log 2>&1"
   ```

2. **Working Directory**: Always specify `workingDir` for Laravel commands to ensure they are executed from the correct location.

3. **Container Selection**: Use `allContainers: true` carefully to avoid duplicate operations in a multi-container setup.

4. **Timing Considerations**: Schedule intensive tasks during off-peak hours.

## Monitoring

Enable detailed scheduler [logging](/frameworks/laravel/logs) in your `.env`:

```
LOG_CHANNEL=daily
```
