The Php Nginx service contains the Nginx web server optimized for your static content. Php Nginx service is highly scalable and customisable to suit both development and production.

## Service using Zerops GUI

 Go to the project's page and choose **Add new service** in the left menu in the **Services** block. Then add a new Php Nginx service:

<Image
  lightImage="/img/gui/php-nginx/service.png"
  darkImage="/img/gui/php-nginx/service.png"
  alt="Add a new service"
  style={{ width: '95%', height: 'auto' }}
/>

### Choose Php Nginx version

Following Php Nginx & apache major versions are currently supported:

<UnorderedList data={data.php.base.runtime.nginx} />

### Set a hostname

Enter a unique service identifier like "app","cache", "gui" etc. Duplicate services with the same name in the same project are forbidden.

:::caution
The hostname is fixed after the service is created. It can't be changed later.
:::

### Set secret env variables

Add environment variables with sensitive data, such as password, tokens, salts, certificates etc. These will be securely saved inside Zerops and added to your runtime service upon start.

Setting the secret environment variables is optional. You can set them later in Zerops GUI.

Read more about [different types of env variables](/frameworks/laravel/env-variables) in Zerops.

### Set auto scaling configuration

Zerops scales the Php Nginx services automatically both vertically and horizontally. Vertical scaling means increasing or decreasing the hardware resources (CPU, RAM and disk) of a Php Nginx container. Horizontal scaling adds or removes whole containers.

You can learn more about [auto scaling](/features/scaling-ha) in Zerops.

    alt="Automatic Scaling"
    style={{ width: '95%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</p>

## Service using Yaml from Zerops GUI

If you want to import a service to an existing project, you can use Zerops GUI or [zCLI](/references/cli/commands#service).

- Go to the project's page and choose **Import services** in the left menu in the **Services** page.
- Then add a new Php Nginx service:

```yml
services:
  - hostname: app
    type: php-nginx@8.4
```

If you want to generate a random strings, secrets, etc. you can use the `#yamlPreprocessor=on` line at the beginning of your import YAML script and read more about how to setup [env variables](/frameworks/laravel/env-variables).
