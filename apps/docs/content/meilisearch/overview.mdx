desc: Production-ready Meilisearch on Zerops platform with managed infrastructure and automatic security configuration. Deploy and run search with zero operational overhead.
---

import UnorderedList from '@site/src/components/UnorderedList';
import UnorderedCodeList from '@site/src/components/UnorderedCodeList';
import data from '@site/static/data.json';

Deploy and manage Meilisearch on a fully managed infrastructure. Get instant access to fast, typo-tolerant search with zero operational overhead.

## Supported Versions

Currently supported Meilisearch versions:
<UnorderedList data={data.meilisearch.readable}/>

Import configuration version:
<UnorderedCodeList data={data.meilisearch.import}/>

## Service Configuration

Our Meilisearch implementation runs as a **single-node** setup, as Meilisearch does not currently support cluster configurations.

### Environment Modes

:::note
Environment mode affects the availability of certain features and can impact your application's security. Choose carefully based on your use case.
:::

#### Production Mode (Default)
- Optimized for performance and security
- Search Preview (Mini-dashboard) disabled
- Recommended for production deployments

#### Development Mode
- Includes Search Preview (Mini-dashboard)
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Suitable for development and testing

To switch between modes:
1. Navigate to the **Environment variables** section in the Meilisearch service detail and scroll to the **Generated Variables**
2. Set the `environment` variable to either:
   - `production` - for production mode (default)
   - `development` - for development mode with Mini-dashboard
3. Restart the service to apply changes

### API Key Management

The service provides three pre-configured API keys, each with specific access levels:

#### `masterKey`
- Root access to your Meilisearch instance
- Use only for initial setup and key management
- **Never expose in application code or frontend**

#### `defaultSearchKey`
- Read-only search operations across all indices
- Safe for frontend implementations
- **Can be exposed in client-side code**

#### `defaultAdminKey`
- Full administrative access to all indices
- For backend operations and index management
- **Keep secure in backend services only**

[Custom API keys](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/reference/api/keys) provide fine-grained access control for specific use cases. For example, you might create:
- Search-only keys for specific indices
- Temporary keys with expiration dates
- Keys with restricted actions for third-party integrations

## Network Architecture & Access

### Access Methods

#### Public HTTPS Access
When enabled, access via [Zerops subdomain](/features/access#public-access-through-zerops-subdomain).

#### Internal Project Access
Services within the same project can reach Meilisearch directly:
```
http://{hostname}:7700
```

## Backup

Meilisearch backups are created using native dump commands:

- **Format**: `.dump` (standard Meilisearch dump)
- **Tooling**: Native dump command
- **Content**: Contains index data and settings

For backup configuration, scheduling, retention policies, and management options, see the [Zerops Backups](/documentation/backup) documentation.

### Restoring Backups

To restore a Meilisearch backup:

1. **Download** the backup file (`.dump`) from the Zerops UI
2. **Prepare** your target environment (clean existing indices or use a new instance)
3. **Restore** using the Meilisearch API. Use the dump import endpoint to restore your data. Follow the [official Meilisearch documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/data_backup/dumps#importing-a-dump-in-self-hosted-instances) for detailed restore procedures.

For assistance with the restoration process, contact Zerops support.

## Quick Start Example

Here's a minimal example of implementing search in a React application:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

const MEILISEARCH_URL = process.env.zeropsSubdomain;
const SEARCH_KEY = process.env.defaultSearchKey;

function SearchComponent() {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);

  const handleSearch = async (query) => {
    const response = await fetch(`${MEILISEARCH_URL}/indexes/products/search`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${SEARCH_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        q: query,
        limit: 10
      })
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    setResults(data.hits);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="search"
        onChange={(e) => handleSearch(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search products..."
      />
      <ul>
        {results.map(hit => (
          <li key={hit.id}>{hit.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

#### Security
- Store sensitive keys (`masterKey`, `defaultAdminKey`) securely in backend services
- Use `defaultSearchKey` or custom keys with minimal permissions for frontend
- Rotate custom keys periodically

#### Performance
- Implement debouncing for search inputs
- Cache frequently accessed search results
- Monitor response times and adjust index settings
- Use appropriate batch sizes for bulk operations

#### Error Handling
- Implement retry logic for temporary failures
- Set appropriate timeout values for your use case
- Handle rate limiting gracefully

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Problems
- Check if your instance is in the correct environment mode
- Ensure your API keys have the necessary permissions
- Confirm your service is running and healthy in the Zerops dashboard

#### Search Performance
- Review your index settings for optimal search performance
- Monitor your instance's resource usage
- Consider implementing client-side caching for frequent searches

#### API Key Issues
- Verify you're using the correct key type for your operation (search vs. admin)
- Check key permissions match your intended operations
- Ensure keys are properly formatted in your Authorization header
- Remember that master and admin keys should never be used in frontend code
