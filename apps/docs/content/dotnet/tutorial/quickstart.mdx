As said, there is no need for coding yet, we have created a [Github repository ↗](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-dotnet-hello-world), a **_recipe_**, containing the most simple .NET web application. The repo will be used as a source from which the app will be built.

<CustomCard title="Feel free to deploy the recipe yourself" emoji="🚀">
  This is the most bare-bones example of .NET running on Zerops — as few libraries as possible,
  just a simple endpoint with connnect, read and write to a Zerops PostgreSQL database.

1. Log in/sign up to [Zerops GUI ↗](https://app.zerops.io)
2. In the **Projects** box click on **Import a project** and paste in the following yml config ([source ↗](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-dotnet-hello-world/blob/main/import-project/description.yml)):

```yml
project:
  name: my-first-project
services:
  - hostname: helloworld
    type: dotnet@latest
    minContainers: 1
    maxContainers: 3
    buildFromGit: https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-dotnet-hello-world@main
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
```

3. Click on **Import project** and wait until all pipelines have finished.

**That's it, your application is now up and running! :star: Let's check it works:**

1. A _subdomain_ should have been enabled and visible in the project's **IP addressed & Public Routing Overview** box. Its format should look similar to this `https://helloworld-24-8080.prg1.zerops.app`.
2. Click or the `subdomain` URL to open it in a browser and you should see

```
Hello, World!
```
