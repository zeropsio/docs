Zerops provides a customizable build environment for your .NET application.

## Add zerops.yml to your repository

Start by adding `zerops.yml` file to the **root of your repository** and modify it to fit your application:

```yml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Set the base technology for the build environment:
      base: dotnet@6

      # OPTIONAL. Set the operating system for the build environment.
      # os: ubuntu

      # OPTIONAL. Customise the build environment by installing additional packages
      # or tools to the base build environment.
      # prepareCommands:
      #   - apt-get something
      #   - curl something else

      # REQUIRED. Build your application
      buildCommands:
        - npm i
        - npm run build

      # REQUIRED. Select which files / folders to deploy after
      # the build has successfully finished
      deployFiles:
        - dist
        - package.json
        - node_modules

      # OPTIONAL. Which files / folders you want to cache for the next build.
      # Next builds will be faster when the cache is used.
      cache: node_modules

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the runtime .NET environment by installing additional
      # dependencies to the base .NET runtime environment.
      # prepareCommands:
      #   - apt-get something
      #   - curl something else

      # OPTIONAL. Run one or more commands each time a new runtime container
      # is started or restarted. These commands are triggered before
      # your .NET application is started.
      # init:
      #  - rm -rf ./cache

      # REQUIRED. Your .NET application start command
      start: npm start
```

The top-level element is always `zerops`.

### Setup

The first element `setup` contains the **hostname** of your service. A runtime service with the same hostname must exist in Zerops.
Zerops supports the definition of multiple runtime services in a single `zerops.yml`. This is useful when you use a monorepo. Just add multiple setup elements in your `zerops.yml`:

```yml
zerops:
  # definition for app service
  - setup: app
    build:
      ...
    run:
      ...

  # definition for api service
  - setup: api
    build:
      ...
    run:
      ...
```

Each service configuration contains at least two sections: **build** and **run**. Both sections are required to build and deploy your Node.js application in Zerops. If you'd like to use a readiness check, add an optional **deploy** section.

## Build pipeline configuration
### base
_REQUIRED._ Sets the base technology for the build environment.

Following options are available for .NET builds:
* `dotnet@6`
* `dotnet@7`
* `dotnet@latest`

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base: dotnet@6
      ...
```

<p>The base build environment contains {data.alpineVersion}, the selected major version of .NET, <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a>, `ASP .NET` and `git`.</p>

:::info
You can change the base environment when you need to. Just simply modify the `zerops.yml` in your repository.
:::

If you need to install more technologies to the build environment, set multiple values as a yaml array. For example:

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base:
        - dotnet@6
        - go@latest
      ...
```

See the full list of supported [build base environments](/references/base-list#net).

To customise your build environment use the [prepareCommands](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands) attribute.

### os
_OPTIONAL._ Sets the operating system for the build environment.

Following options are available:
* `alpine`
* `ubuntu`

Default value is `alpine`.

We are currently using following os version:
* <span>{data.alpineVersion}</span>
* <span>{data.ubuntuVersion}</span>

:::caution
The os version is fixed and cannot be customised.
:::

### prepareCommands
_OPTIONAL._ Customises the build environment by installing additional dependencies or tools to the base build environment.

The base build environment contains:
* <span>{data.alpineVersion}</span>
* selected version of .NET defined in the [base](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#base) attribute
* [Zerops command line tool](/references/cli)
* ASP .NET` and `git`

To install additional packages or tools add one or more prepare commands:

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Set the base technology for the build environment:
      base: dotnet@6

      # OPTIONAL. Customise the build environment by installing additional packages
      # or tools to the base build environment.
      prepareCommands:
        - apt-get something
        - curl something else
      ...
```

When the first build is triggered, Zerops will
1. create a build container
2. download your application code from your repository
3. run the prepare commands in the defined order

The application code is available in the `/var/www` folder in your build container before the prepare commands are triggered. This allows you to use any file from your application code in your prepare commands (e.g. a configuration file).

#### Command exit code

If any command fails, it returns an exit code other than 0 and the build is canceled. Read the [build log](/dotnet/how-to/logs#build-log) to troubleshoot the error. If the command ends successfully, it returns the exit code 0 and Zerops triggers the following command. When all prepare commands are finished, your custom build environment is ready for the build phase.

#### Single or separated shell instances

You can configure your prepare commands to be run in a single shell instance or multiple shell instances. The format is identical to [build commands](#buildcommands).

#### Cache of your custom build environment

Some packages or tools can take a long time to install. Therefore, Zerops caches your custom build environment after each successful build where the prepare commands were used. When the second or following build is triggered, Zerops will use the build cache from the previous build if both following conditions are met:
1. Content of the base and prepare attributes didn't change from the previous build
2. The build cache wasn't invalidated in the Zerops GUI.

To invalidate the Zerops build cache go to your service detail in Zerops GUI, choose **Service dashboard & runtime containers** from the left menu and click on the **Open pipeline detail** button. Then click on the **Invalidate build cache** icon.

**// TODO screenshot**

When the build cache is used, Zerops doesn't run the `prepareCommands` commands and the build of your application is faster.

### buildCommands
_REQUIRED._ Defines build commands.

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Set the base technology for the build environment:
      base: dotnet@6

      # REQUIRED. Build your application
      buildCommands:
        - dotnet build -o app
      ...
```

At least one command is required. Zerops triggers each command in the defined order in a dedicated build container.

Before the build commands are triggered the build container contains:
1. base environment defined by the [base](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#base) attribute
2. optional customisation of the base environment defined in the [prepareCommands](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands) attribute
3. your application code

#### Run build commands as a single shell instance

Use following syntax to run all commands in the same environment context. For example, if one command changes the current directory, the next command continues in that directory. When one command creates an environment variable, the next command can access it.

```yml
buildCommands:
 - |
   apt-get -y install dotnet-runtime-6.0 aspnetcore-runtime-6.0 dotnet-sdk-6.0 # already installed for .NET service
   dotnet build -o app
```

#### Run build commands as a separate shell instances

When the following syntax is used, each command is triggered in a separate environment context. For example, each shell instance starts in the home directory again. When one command creates an environment variable, it won't be available for the next command.

```yml
buildCommands:
 - apt-get -y install dotnet-runtime-6.0 aspnetcore-runtime-6.0 dotnet-sdk-6.0 # already installed for .NET service
 - dotnet build -o app
```

#### Command exit code

If any command fails, it returns an exit code other than 0 and the build is canceled. Read the [build log](/dotnet/how-to/logs#build-log) to troubleshoot the error. If the error log doesn't contain any specific error message, try to run your build with the `--verbosity <LEVEL>` option.

```yml
buildCommands:
 - dotnet build --verbosity detailed
```

If the command ends successfully, it returns the exit code 0 and Zerops triggers the following command. When all `buildCommands` are finished, the application build is completed and ready for the [deploy](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#deploy) phase.

### deployFiles
_REQUIRED._ Selects which files or folders will be deployed after the build has successfully finished.

```yml
# REQUIRED. Select which files / folders to deploy after
# the build has successfully finished
deployFiles:
  - app
```

Determines files or folders produced by your build, which should be deployed to your runtime service containers.

The path starts from the **root directory** of your project (the location of `zerops.yml`). You must enclose the name in quotes if the folder or the file name contains a space.

#### Examples

Deploys a folder, and a file from the project root directory:
```yml
deployFiles:
  - app
  - file.txt
```

Deploys the whole content of the build container:
```yml
deployFiles: .
```

Deploys a folder, and a file in a defined path:
```yml
deployFiles:
  - ./path/to/file.txt
  - ./path/to/dir/
```

#### How to use a wildcard in the path
Zerops supports the `~` character as a wildcard for one or more folders in the path.

Deploys all `file.txt` files that are located in any path that begins with `/path/` and ends with `/to/`
```yml
deployFiles: ./path/~/to/file.txt
```

Deploys all folders that are located in any path that begins with `/path/to/`
```yml
deployFiles: ./path/to/~/
```

Deploys all folders that are located in any path that begins with `/path/` and ends with `/to/`
```yml
deployFiles: ./path/~/to/
```

### cache
_OPTIONAL._ Defines which files or folders will be cached for the next build.

```yml
# OPTIONAL. Which files / folders you want to cache for the next build.
# Next builds will be faster when the cache is used.
cache: file.txt
```

By default, Zerops doesn't cache the files in the build container. When the build phase is finished, the files and folders defined in the [deploy](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#deploy) attribute are saved and deployed to your runtime containers. Then, the build container is deleted.
To speed the second and following build up, cache the files that can be used in the next build.

The cache attribute supports the [~ wildcard character](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#how-to-use-wildcard-in-path).

### envVariables
_OPTIONAL._ Defines the environment variables for the build environment.

Enter one or more env variables in following format:

```yml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      base: dotnet@6
            …

      # OPTIONAL. Defines the env variables for the build environment:
      envVariables:
        DOTNET_ENV: production
        DB_NAME: db
        DB_HOST: db
        DB_USER: db
        DB_PASS: ${db_password}
```

Read more about [environment variables](/dotnet/how-to/env-variables) in Zerops.

## Runtime configuration
### base
_OPTIONAL._ Sets the base technology for the runtime environment.
If you don't specify the `run.base` attribute, Zerops keeps the current .NET version for your runtime.

Following options are available for .NET builds:
* `dotnet@6`
* `dotnet@7`
* `dotnet@latest`

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base: dotnet@6
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Sets the base technology for the runtime environment:
        base: dotnet@6
      ...
```

<p>The base runtime environment contains {data.alpineVersion}, the selected major version of .NET, <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a> and `ASP .NET` and `git`.</p>

:::info
You can change the base environment when you need to. Just simply modify the `zerops.yml` in your repository.
:::

If you need to install more technologies to the runtime environment, set multiple values as a yaml array. For example:

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base: dotnet@6
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Sets the base technology for the runtime environment:
      base:
        - dotnet@6
        - golang@latest
      ...
```

See the full list of supported [run base environments].

To customise your build environment use the `prepareCommands` attribute.

### os
_OPTIONAL._ Sets the operating system for the runtime environment.

Following options are available:
* `alpine`
* `ubuntu`

Default value is `alpine`.

We are currently using following os version:
* <span>{data.alpineVersion}</span>
* <span>{data.ubuntuVersion}</span>

:::caution
The os version is fixed and cannot be customised.
:::

### prepareCommands
_OPTIONAL._ Customises the .NET runtime environment by installing additional dependencies or tools to the runtime base environment.

<p>The base .NET environment contains {data.alpineVersion}, the selected major version of .NET, <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a> and `ASP .NET` and `git`. To install additional packages or tools add one or more prepare commands:</p>

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the runtime environment by installing additional packages
      # or tolls to the base .NET runtime environment.
      prepareCommands:
        - apt-get something
        - curl something else
      ...
```

When the first deploy with a defined prepare attribute is triggered, Zerops will
1. create a prepare runtime container
2. optionaly: [copy selected folders or files from your build container](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#copy-folders-or-files-from-your-build-container)
3. run the `prepareCommands` commands in the defined order

#### Command exit code

If any command fails, it returns an exit code other than 0 and the deploy is canceled. Read the [prepare runtime log](/dotnet/how-to/logs#prepare-runtime-log) to troubleshoot the error. If the command ends successfully, it returns the exit code 0 and Zerops triggers the following command. When all `prepareCommands` commands are finished, your custom runtime environment is ready for the deploy phase.

#### Cache of your custom runtime environment

Some packages or tools can take a long time to install. Therefore, Zerops caches your custom runtime environment after the installation of your custom packages or tools is completed. When the second or following deploy is triggered, Zerops will use the custom runtime cache from the previous deploy if following conditions are met:
1. Content of the [build.addToRunPrepare](#copy-folders-or-files-from-your-build-container) and `run.prepareCommands` attributes didn't change from the previous deploy
2. The custom runtime cache wasn't invalidated in the Zerops GUI.

To invalidate the Zerops custom runtime cache go to `yyy`

**// TODO screenshot**

When the prepare cache is used, Zerops doesn't create a prepare runtime container and executes the deployment of your application directly.

#### Single or separated shell instances

You can configure your prepare commands to be run in a single shell instance or multiple shell instances. The format is identical to [build commands](#buildcommands).

### Copy folders or files from your build container

<p>The prepare runtime container contains {data.alpineVersion}, the selected major version of .NET, <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a> and `ASP .NET` and `git`.</p>
The prepare runtime container does not contain your application code nor the built application. If you need to copy some folders or files from the build container to the runtime container (e.g. a configuration file) use the `addToRunPrepare` attribute in the [build section](#build-pipeline-configuration).

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...
      addToRunPrepare: ./runtime-config.yml

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the runtime environment by installing additional packages
      # or tolls to the base .NET runtime environment.
      prepareCommands:
        - apt-get something
        - curl something else
      ...
```

In the example above Zerops will copy the `runtime-config.yml` file from your build container **after the build has finished** into the new **prepare runtime** container. The copied files and folders will be available in the `xxx` folder in the new prepare runtime container before the prepare commands are triggered.

### initCommands
_OPTIONAL._ Defines one or more commands to be run each time a new runtime container is started or a container is restarted.

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Run one or more commands each time a new runtime container
      # is started or restarted. These commands are triggered before
      # your .NET application is started.
      initCommands:
        - rm -rf ./cache
```

These commands are triggered in the runtime container before your .NET application is started via the [start command](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#start).

Use init commands to clean or initialise your application cache or similar operations.

:::caution
The init commands will delay the start of your application each time a new runtime container is started (including the [horizontal scaling](/dotnet/how-to/scaling#horizontal-scaling) or when a runtime container is restarted.

Do not use the init commands for customising your runtime environment. Use the [run:prepareCommands](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands-1) attribute instead.
:::

#### Command exit code

If any of the `initCommands` fails, it returns an exit code other than 0, but deploy is **not** canceled. After all init commands are finished, regardless of the status code, the application is started. Read the [runtime log](/dotnet/how-to/logs#runtime-log) to troubleshoot the error.

#### Single or separated shell instances

You can configure your `initCommands` to be run in a single shell instance or multiple shell instances. The format is identical to [build commands](#buildcommands).

### envVariables
_OPTIONAL._ Defines the environment variables for the runtime environment.

Enter one or more env variables in following format:

```yml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:

      # OPTIONAL. Defines the env variables for the runtime environment:
      envVariables:
        DOTNET_ENV: production
        DB_NAME: db
        DB_HOST: db
        DB_USER: db
        DB_PASS: ${db_password}
```

Read more about [environment variables](/dotnet/how-to/env-variables) in Zerops.

### start
_REQUIRED._ Defines the start command for your .NET application.

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:

      # REQUIRED. Your .NET application start command
      start: cd app && dotnet dnet.dll
```

### health check
_OPTIONAL._ Defines a health check.

`healthCheck` requires either one `httpGet` object or one `exec` object.

#### httpGet
Configures the health check to request a local URL using a HTTP GET method.

Following attributes are available:

| Parameter              | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **port**               | Defines the port of the HTTP GET request.<br/>The readiness check will trigger a GET request on `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/{path}` |
| **path**               | Defines the URL path of the HTTP GET request.<br/>The readiness check will trigger a GET request on `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/{path}`                                 |
| **host**               | **Optional.**  The readiness check is triggered from inside of your runtime container so it always uses the localhost (`127.0.0.1`). If you need to add a `host` to the request header, specify it in the `host` attribute.          |
| **scheme**               | **Optional.** The readiness check is triggered from inside of your runtime container so no https is required.<br/>If your application requires a https request, set `scheme: https`          |

**Example:**

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:

      # REQUIRED. Your .NET application start command
      start: cd app && dotnet dnet.dll

      # OPTIONAL. Define a health check with a HTTP GET request option.
      # Configures the check on http://127.0.0.1:80/status
      healthCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /status
```

Read more about how the [health check works] in Zerops.

#### exec
Configures the health check to run a local command.
Following attributes are available:

| Parameter              | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **command** | Defines a local command to be run.<br/>The command has access to the same [environment variables](/dotnet/how-to/create#set-environment-variables) as your .NET application.<br/>A single string is required. If you need to run multiple commands create a shell script or, use a multiline format as in the example below. |

**Example:**

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:

      # REQUIRED. Your .NET application start command
      start: cd app && dotnet dnet.dll

      # OPTIONAL. Define a health check with a shell command.
      healthCheck:
        exec:
          command: |
            touch grass
            rm -rf life
            mv /outside/user /home/user
```

## Deploy configuration

### readiness check
_OPTIONAL._ Defines a readiness check. Read more about how the [readiness check works](/dotnet/how-to/deploy-process#readiness-checks) in Zerops.

`readinessCheck` requires either one `httpGet` object or one `exec` object.

#### httpGet
Configures the readiness check to request a local URL using a http GET method.

Following attributes are available:

| Parameter              | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **port**               | Defines the port of the HTTP GET request.<br/>The readiness check will trigger a GET request on `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/{path}` |
| **path**               | Defines the URL path of the HTTP GET request.<br/>The readiness check will trigger a GET request on `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/{path}`                                 |
| **host**               | **Optional.**  The readiness check is triggered from inside of your runtime container so it always uses the localhost (`127.0.0.1`). If you need to add a `host` to the request header, specify it in the `host` attribute.          |
| **scheme**             | **Optional.** The readiness check is triggered from inside of your runtime container so no https is required.<br/>If your application requires a https request, set `scheme: https`          |

**Example:**

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...

    # ==== how to deploy your application ====
    deploy:

      # OPTIONAL. Define a readiness check with a HTTP GET request option.
      # Configures the check on http://127.0.0.1:80/status
      readinessCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /status

    # ==== how to run your application ====

| **command** | Defines a local command to be run.<br/>The command has access to the same [environment variables](/dotnet/how-to/create#set-environment-variables) as your .NET application.<br/>A single string is required. If you need to run multiple commands create a shell script or, use a multiline format as in the example below. |

**Example:**

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...

    # ==== how to deploy your application ====
    deploy:

      # OPTIONAL. Define a readiness check with a HTTP GET request option.
      # Configures the check on http://127.0.0.1:80/status
      readinessCheck:
        exec:
          command: |
            touch grass
            rm -rf life
            mv /outside/user /home/user
```
