title: Create a .NET service in Zerops
---

Zerops provides a .NET runtime service with extensive build support. .NET runtime is highly scalable and customisable to suit both development and production.

## Create .NET service using Zerops GUI

First, set up a project in Zerops GUI. Then go to the project dashboard page and choose **Add new service** in the left menu in the **Services** block. Then add a new .NET service:

**// TODO screenshot (add a new service page)**

### Choose .NET version
Following .NET major versions are currently supported:
* 6

:::caution
The .NET major version is fixed after the service is created. It can't be changed later.
:::

### Set a hostname
Enter a unique service identifier like "app","cache", "gui" etc. Duplicate services with the same name in the same project are forbidden.

#### Limitations:
* maximum 25 characters
* must contain only lowercase ASCII letters (a-z) or numbers (0-9)

:::caution
The hostname is fixed after the service is created. It can't be changed later.
:::

### Configure internal ports
Specify one or more internal ports on which your application will listen. The TCP port **5000** is predefined. You can set your own port number, configure multiple ports or create a service without an internal port.

Projects in Zerops represent a group of one or more services. Services can be of different types (runtime services, databases, message brokers, object storage, etc.). All services of the same project share a **dedicated private network**. To connect to a service within the same project, just use the service hostname and its internal port.

For example, to connect to a .NET service with hostname = "app" and port = 5000 from another service of the same project, simply use `app:5000`. Read more about [how to access a .NET service](/dotnet/how-to/access).

To add a new internal port, click on the **Open a new internal port** button.

</p>

In the form, enter following information:

1. Select **TCP** or **UDP** protocol.
2. Check **HTTP protocol support** if a web server runs on the port. Zerops uses this information for the configuration of [external routing]. This option is available only in combination with the **TCP** protocol.
3. Enter the **port number**. The port number must be set between 10 and 65435. Ports outside this interval are reserved for internal Zerops systems.

:::info
Internal .NET service ports can be changed later.
:::

## Set secret env variables
Add environment variables with sensitive data, such as password, tokens, salts, certificates etc. These will be securely saved inside Zerops and added to your runtime service upon start.

Setting the secret environment variables is optional. You can set them later in Zerops GUI.

Read more about [different types of env variables](/dotnet/how-to/env-variables#types-of-env-variables-in-zerops) in Zerops.

### Set auto scaling configuration
Zerops scales the .NET services automatically both vertically and horizontally. Vertical scaling means increasing or decreasing the hardware resources (CPU, RAM and disk) of a .NET container. Horizontal scaling adds or removes whole containers.

#### Vertical auto scaling

Vertical auto scaling has following default configuration:

| &nbsp;              | Minimum resource | Maximum resource |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **vCPU**            | 1                | 20               |
| **RAM**             | 0.25 GB          | 32 GB            |
| **Disk**            | 1 GB             | 100 GB           |

.NET service always starts with the minimal resources.

For most cases, the default parameters will work without issues. If you need to limit the cost of the .NET service, lower the maximal resources. Zerops will never scale above the selected maximums.

When you are experiencing problems with insufficient .NET performance or capacity, increase the minimal resources. Zerops will never scale below the selected minimums.

:::info
You can change the vertical auto scaling parameters later.
:::

</p>

#### Horizontal auto scaling

When a container needs more CPU or RAM but already consumes maximal resources defined for the vertical auto scaling, Zerops will add a new container to your .NET service. When your .NET service doesn't need so much power and all containers are vertically scaled down in such a way their CPU allocation is near the minimal resources, Zerops will gradually remove whole containers.

Horizontal auto scaling has following default configuration:
<table>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td><b>minimum containers</b></td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>maximum containers</b></td>
		<td>6</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

.NET service always starts with the minimum number of containers.

You can increase the minimum or decrease the maximum number of containers. The horizontal scaling parameters can be changed later.

:::caution
Check if your application is ready for [highly available mode](/dotnet/how-to/scaling#horizontal-scaling). If not, set the maximum containers to **1**. Zerops will never add more containers to your .NET service.
:::

:::caution
You can keep the minimum at 1 container, but you should do so with caution and only for non-critical or dev services. Production grade service should start with at least 2 containers.

## Create .NET service using zCLI
zCLI is the Zerops command-line tool. To create a new .NET service via the command-line, follow these steps:
1. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli)
2. [Create a project description file](/dotnet/how-to/create#create-a-project-description-file)
3. [Create a project with a .NET and PostgreSQL service](#full-example)

### Create a project description file
Zerops uses a yaml format to describe the project infrastructure.

#### Basic example:

Create a directory `my-project`. Create an `description.yml` file inside the `my-project` directory with following content:

```yaml
# basic project data
project:
  # project name
  name: my-project
# array of project services
services:
  -
    # service name
    hostname: app
    # service type and version number in dotnet@6 format
    type: dotnet@6
    # internal ports configuration
    ports:
      -
         # port number
         port: 5000
    # defines the minimum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling
    minContainers: 1
    # defines the maximum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling. Max value = 6.
    maxContainers: 6
    # optional: create env variables
    envSecrets:
      S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "P8cX1vVVb"
      S3_ACCESS_SECRET: "ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

The yaml file describes your future project infrastructure. The project will contain one .NET version 6 service with default [auto scaling](/dotnet/how-to/scaling) configuration. Hostname will be set to "app" and the application will listen on the TCP port 5000 that supports the HTTP communication. Following env variables will be configured:

```env
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="P8cX1vVVb"
S3_ACCESS_SECRET="ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

#### Full example:

Create a directory my-project. Create an description.yml file inside the my-project directory with following content:

```yaml
# basic project data
project:
  # project name
  name: my-project
  # optional: project description
  description: A project with a .NET and PostgreSQL database
  # optional: project tags
  tags:
    - DEMO
    - ZEROPS
# array of project services
services:
  -
    # service name
    hostname: app
    # service type and version number in dotnet@6 format
    type: dotnet@6
    # internal ports configuration
    ports:
      -
         # port number
         port: 5000
      -
         # port number
         port: 5001
         # set false if a webserver is NOT running on the port. Default = true.
         httpSupport: false
      -
         # port number
         port: 6000
         # set the "UDP" or "TCP" protocol, default "TCP"
         protocol: UDP
    # optional: vertical auto scaling customization
    verticalAutoscaling:
      minVCpu: 5
      maxVCpu: 10
      minRam: 2
      maxRam: 16
      minDisk: 2.5
      maxDisk: 50
    # defines the minimum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling. Max value = 6.
    minContainers: 2
    # defines the maximum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling. Max value = 6.
    maxContainers: 4
    # optional: create secret env variables
    envSecrets:
      S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "P8cX1vVVb"
      S3_ACCESS_SECRET: "ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
  -
    # second service hostname
    hostname: db
    # service type and version number in postgresql@{version} format
    type: postgresql@12
    # mode of operation "HA"/"non_HA"
    mode: NON_HA
```

The yaml file describes your future project infrastructure. The project will contain a .NET service and a [PostgreSQL](/postgresql/overview) service.

.NET service with "app" hostname is configured to listen on tcp ports 5000, 5001 and on udp port 6000. .NET service will run on version 6 with a custom vertical and horizontal scaling. Following secret env variables will be configured:

```env
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="P8cX1vVVb"
S3_ACCESS_SECRET="ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

The hostname of the PostgreSQL service will be set to "db". The [single container](/postgresql/how-to/create#single-container) mode will be chosen and the default [auto scaling configuration](/postgresql/how-to/create#set-auto-scaling-configuration) will be set.

#### Description of description.yml parameters

The `project:` section is required. Only one project can be defined.

| Parameter              | Description                                                                   | Limitations             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------             |
| **name**               | The name of the new project. Duplicates are allowed.                          |                         |
| **description**        | **Optional.** Description of the new project.                                 | Maximum 255 characters. |
| **tags**               | **Optional.** One or more string tags. Tags do not have a functional meaning, they only provide better orientation in projects.          |


At least one service in `services:` section is required. You can create a project with multiple services. The example above contains .NET and PostgreSQL services but you can create a `description.yml` with your own combination of [services].

### Create a project based on the description.yml

When you have your `description.yml` ready, use the `zcli project project-import` command to create a new project and the service infrastructure.

```sh
Usage:
  zcli project project-import importYamlPath [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help                the project import command.
      --orgId string        If you have access to more than one organization, you must specify the org ID for which the
                            project is to be created.
      --workingDie string   Sets a custom working directory. Default working directory is the current directory. (default "./")
```

Zerops will create a project and one or more services based on the `description.yml` content.

Maximum size of the `description.yml` file is 100 kB.

You don't specify the project name in the `zcli project project-import` command, because the project name is defined in the `description.yml`.

If you have access to more than one client, you must specify the client ID for which the project is to be created. The `clientID` is located in the Zerops GUI under the client name on the project dashboard page.

**// TODO screenshot (where the clientID is located in Zerops GUI)**

### Add .NET service to an existing project

#### Example:

Create a directory `my-project` if it doesn't exist. Create an `import.yml` file inside the `my-project` directory with following content:

```yaml
# basic project data
project:
  # project name
  name: my-project
# array of project services
services:
  -
    # service name
    hostname: app
    # service type and version number in dotnet@6 format
    type: dotnet@6
    # internal ports configuration
    ports:
      -
         # port number
         port: 5000
    # defines the minimum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling
    minContainers: 1
    # defines the maximum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling. Max value = 6.
    maxContainers: 6
    # optional: create env variables
    envSecrets:
      S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "P8cX1vVVb"
      S3_ACCESS_SECRET: "ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

The yaml file describes the list of one or more services that you want to add to your existing project. In the example above, one .NET service version 6 listening on the port 5000 with default [auto scaling](/dotnet/how-to/scaling) configuration will be added to your project. Hostname of the new service will be set to `app`. Following env variables will be configured:

```env
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="P8cX1vVVb"
S3_ACCESS_SECRET="ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

The content of the `services:` section of `import.yml` is identical to the project description file. The `import.yml` never contains the `project:` section because the project already exists.

When you have your `import.yml` ready, use the `zcli project service-import` command to add one or more services to your existing Zerops project.

```sh
Usage:
  zcli project service-import importYamlPath [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help               the project service import command.
      --projectId string   If you have access to more than one project, you must specify the project ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
```

zCLI commands are interactive, when you press enter after `zcli project service-import importYamlPath`, you will be given a list of your projects to choose from.

Maximum size of the import.yml file is 100 kB.
