title: How to upgrade the Nginx version
---

You can upgrade or downgrade your Nginx static service to a different major Nginx version by setting the <a href="/nginx/how-to/build-pipeline#base-1">`run.base`</a> parameter in your `zerops.yml`. When you [trigger a new pipeline](/nginx/how-to/trigger-pipeline), Zerops will start new runtime container(s) with the required Nginx version. If you don't specify the `run.base` attribute in your `zerops.yml`, Zerops keeps the current Nginx version for your runtime.
