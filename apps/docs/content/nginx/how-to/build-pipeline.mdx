import data from '@site/static/data.json';
import UnorderedCodeList from '@site/src/components/UnorderedCodeList';

Zerops provides a customizable build and runtime environment for your static content.

Zerops supports different build environments:

- [Node.js](/nodejs/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [PHP](/php/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [Python](/python/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [Go](/go/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [.NET](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [Rust](/rust/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [Java](/java/how-to/build-pipeline)

If you just need to deploy your static content, use the [manual deploy](/nginx/how-to/trigger-pipeline#manual-deploy-using-zerops-cli) via Zerops CLI.

## Add zerops.yml to your repository

Start by adding `zerops.yml` file to the **root of your repository** and modify it to fit your application:

```yml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Set the base technology for the build environment:
      base: nodejs@latest

      # OPTIONAL. Set the operating system for the build environment.
      # os: ubuntu

      # OPTIONAL. Customise the build environment by installing additional packages
      # or tools to the base build environment.
      # prepareCommands:
      #   - apt-get something
      #   - curl something else

      # REQUIRED. Build your application
      buildCommands:
        - npm i
        - npm run build

      # REQUIRED. Select which files / folders to deploy after
      # the build has successfully finished
      deployFiles:
        - dist
        - package.json
        - node_modules

      # OPTIONAL. Which files / folders you want to cache for the next build.
      # Next builds will be faster when the cache is used.
      cache: node_modules

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Sets the base technology for the runtime environment:
      base: nginx@latest

      # OPTIONAL. Customise the runtime Nginx environment by installing additional
      # dependencies to the base Nginx runtime environment.
      # prepareCommands:
      #   - apt-get something
      #   - curl something else

      # OPTIONAL. Run one or more commands each time a new runtime container
      # is started or restarted. These commands are triggered before
      # your Nginx application is started.
      # init:
      #  - rm -rf ./cache

      # OPTIONAL. Customise the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly
      # accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the /var/www folder.
      documentRoot: public

      # OPTIONAL. Sets the custom Nginx configuration. The file must be deployed in
      # the runtime container. Enter the path to the file relative to the /var/www folder
      siteConfigPath: site_config.tmpl
```

The top-level element is always `zerops`.

### Setup

The first element `setup` contains the **hostname** of your service. A runtime service with the same hostname must exist in Zerops.
Zerops supports the definition of multiple runtime services in a single `zerops.yml`. This is useful when you use a monorepo. Just add multiple setup elements in your `zerops.yml`:

```yml
zerops:
  # definition for app service
  - setup: app
    build: ...
    run: ...

  # definition for api service
  - setup: api
    build: ...
    run: ...
```

Each service configuration contains at least two sections: **build** and **run**. Both sections are required to build and deploy your Nginx application in Zerops. If you'd like to use a readiness check, add an optional **deploy** section.

## Build pipeline configuration

Zerops supports different build environments:

- [Node.js](/nodejs/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [PHP](/php/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [Python](/python/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [Go](/go/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [.NET](/dotnet/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [Rust](/rust/how-to/build-pipeline)
- [Java](/java/how-to/build-pipeline)

If you just need to deploy your static content, use the [manual deploy](/nginx/how-to/trigger-pipeline#manual-deploy-using-zerops-cli) via Zerops CLI.

## Runtime configuration

### base

_OPTIONAL._ Sets the base technology for the runtime environment.
If you don't specify the `run.base` attribute, Zerops keeps the current Nginx version for your runtime.

Following options are available for Nginx builds:

<UnorderedCodeList data={data.nginxVersions} />

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base: nodejs@latest
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Sets the base technology for the runtime environment:
        base: nginx@latest
      ...
```

<p>
  The base runtime environment contains {data.alpineCurrentVersion}, the
  selected major version of Nginx,{' '}
  <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a> and{' '}
  <code>composer</code>, <code>git</code> and <code>wget</code>.
</p>

:::info
You can change the base environment when you need to. Just simply modify the `zerops.yml` in your repository.
:::

If you need to install more technologies to the runtime environment, set multiple values as a yaml array. For example:

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base: nodejs@latest
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Sets the base technology for the runtime environment:
      base:
        - nginx@latest
        - golang@latest
      ...
```

See the full list of supported [run base environments](/references/zeropsyml/base-list).

To customise your build environment use the `prepareCommands` attribute.

### os

_OPTIONAL._ Sets the operating system for the runtime environment.

Following options are available:

- `alpine`
- `ubuntu`

Default value is `alpine`.

We are currently using following os version:

- <span>{data.alpineCurrentVersion}</span>
- <span>{data.ubuntuCurrentVersion}</span>

:::caution
The os version is fixed and cannot be customised.
:::

### ports

_OPTIONAL._ Specifies one or more internal ports on which your application will listen.

:::info
If no ports are specified, Zerops adds the port TCP 80 automatically.
:::

:::caution
If you want the web server to listen on other port(s) than `:80`, you must [customize](/nginx/how-to/build-pipeline#customize-web-server) your web server configuration as well.
:::

Projects in Zerops represent a group of one or more services. Services can be of different types (runtime services, databases, message brokers, object storage, etc.). All services of the same project share a **dedicated private network**. To connect to a service within the same project, just use the service hostname and its internal port.

For example, to connect to a Nginx static service with hostname = "app" and port = 80 from another service of the same project, simply use `app:80`. Read more about [how to access a Nginx static service](/nginx/how-to/access).

:::info
Do not use the port **:443**. All the incoming traffic is terminated on the Zerops internal balancer where the SSL certificate is installed and the request is forwarded to your Nginx static service as a **http://** on the port **:80**.
:::

Each port has following attributes:

| parameter   | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| port        | Defines the port number. You can set any port number between _10_ and _65435_. Ports outside this interval are reserved for internal Zerops systems.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| protocol    | **Optional.** Defines the protocol. Allowed values are `TCP` or `UDP`. Default value is `TCP`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| httpSupport | **Optional.** `httpSupport = true` is the default setting for TCP protocol. Set `httpSupport = false` if a web server isn't running on the port. Zerops uses this information for the configuration of [public access](/features/access). `httpSupport = true` is available only in combination with the TCP protocol. |

### prepareCommands

_OPTIONAL._ Customises the Nginx runtime environment by installing additional dependencies or tools to the runtime base environment.

<p>
  The base Nginx environment contains {data.alpineCurrentVersion}, the selected
  major version of Nginx, <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a>{' '}
  and <code>composer</code>, <code>git</code> and <code>wget</code>. To install
  additional packages or tools add one or more prepare commands:
</p>

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the runtime environment by installing additional packages
      # or tools to the base Nginx runtime environment.
      prepareCommands:
        - apt-get something
        - curl something else
      ...
```

When the first deploy with a defined prepare attribute is triggered, Zerops will

1. create a prepare runtime container
2. optionally: [copy selected folders or files from your build container](/nginx/how-to/build-pipeline#copy-folders-or-files-from-your-build-container)
3. run the `prepareCommands` commands in the defined order

#### Command exit code

If any command fails, it returns an exit code other than 0 and the deploy is canceled. Read the [prepare runtime log](/nginx/how-to/logs#prepare-runtime-log) to troubleshoot the error. If the command ends successfully, it returns the exit code 0 and Zerops triggers the following command. When all `prepareCommands` commands are finished, your custom runtime environment is ready for the deploy phase.

#### Cache of your custom runtime environment

Some packages or tools can take a long time to install. Therefore, Zerops caches your custom runtime environment after the installation of your custom packages or tools is completed. When the second or following deploy is triggered, Zerops will use the custom runtime cache from the previous deploy if following conditions are met:

1. Content of the [build.addToRunPrepare](#copy-folders-or-files-from-your-build-container) and `run.prepareCommands` attributes didn't change from the previous deploy
2. The custom runtime cache wasn't invalidated in the Zerops GUI.

To invalidate the Zerops custom runtime cache go to `yyy`

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/screenshots/runtime_clear_build_cache.png"
    alt="image"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
  />
</p>

When the prepare cache is used, Zerops doesn't create a prepare runtime container and executes the deployment of your application directly.

#### Single or separated shell instances

You can configure your prepare commands to be run in a single shell instance or multiple shell instances. The format is identical to [build commands](#buildcommands).

### Copy folders or files from your build container

<p>
  The prepare runtime container contains {data.alpineCurrentVersion}, the
  selected major version of Nginx,{' '}
  <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a> and{' '}
  <code>composer</code>, <code>git</code> and <code>wget</code>.
</p>

The prepare runtime container does not contain your application code nor the built application. If you need to copy some folders or files from the build container to the runtime container (e.g. a configuration file) use the `addToRunPrepare` attribute in the [build section](#build-pipeline-configuration).

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...
      addToRunPrepare: ./runtime-config.yml

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the runtime environment by installing additional packages
      # or tools to the base Nginx runtime environment.
      prepareCommands:
        - apt-get something
        - curl something else
      ...
```

In the example above Zerops will copy the `runtime-config.yml` file from your build container **after the build has finished** into the new **prepare runtime** container. The copied files and folders will be available in the `xxx` folder in the new prepare runtime container before the prepare commands are triggered.

### initCommands

_OPTIONAL._ Defines one or more commands to be run each time a new runtime container is started or a container is restarted.

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build: ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Run one or more commands each time a new runtime container
      # is started or restarted. These commands are triggered before
      # your Nginx application is started.
      initCommands:
        - rm -rf ./cache
```

These commands are triggered in the runtime container before your Nginx application is started via the [start command](/nginx/how-to/build-pipeline#start).

Use init commands to clean or initialise your application cache or similar operations.

:::caution
The init commands will delay the start of your application each time a new runtime container is started (including the [horizontal scaling](/nginx/how-to/scaling#horizontal-scaling) or when a runtime container is restarted.

Do not use the init commands for customising your runtime environment. Use the [run:prepareCommands](/nginx/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands-1) attribute instead.
:::

#### Command exit code

If any of the `initCommands` fails, it returns an exit code other than 0, but deploy is **not** canceled. After all init commands are finished, regardless of the status code, the application is started. Read the [runtime log](/nginx/how-to/logs#runtime-log) to troubleshoot the error.

#### Single or separated shell instances

You can configure your `initCommands` to be run in a single shell instance or multiple shell instances. The format is identical to [build commands](#buildcommands).

### documentRoot

_OPTIONAL._ Customizes the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly accessible web server content.

:::info
By default, the document root is configured to `/var/www`.
:::

Customize the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the `/var/www` folder.
E.g. `documentRoot: public` will set the web server document root to `/var/www/public`.

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build: ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly
      # accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the /var/www folder.
      documentRoot: public
```

### siteConfigPath

_OPTIONAL._ Sets the custom Nginx configuration.

:::info
If you don't set your custom configuration Zerops applies the [default](/nginx/how-to/customize-web-server#default-nginx-configuration) configuration.
:::

The file must be deployed in the runtime container. Enter the path to the file relative to the `/var/www` folder.
Read more about the [web server customization](/nginx/how-to/customize-web-server).

### envVariables

_OPTIONAL._ Defines the environment variables for the runtime environment.

Enter one or more env variables in following format:

```yml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Defines the env variables for the runtime environment:
      envVariables:
        DB_NAME: db
        DB_HOST: db
        DB_USER: db
        DB_PASS: ${db_password}
```

Read more about [environment variables](/nginx/how-to/env-variables) in Zerops.

### health check

_OPTIONAL._ Defines a health check.

`healthCheck` requires either one `httpGet` object or one `exec` object.

#### httpGet

Configures the health check to request a local URL using a HTTP GET method.

Following attributes are available:

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **port**   | Defines the port of the HTTP GET request.<br/>The readiness check will trigger a GET request on `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/{path}`                                                                                           |
| **path**   | Defines the URL path of the HTTP GET request.<br/>The readiness check will trigger a GET request on `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/{path}`                                                                                       |
| **host**   | **Optional.** The readiness check is triggered from inside of your runtime container so it always uses the localhost (`127.0.0.1`). If you need to add a `host` to the request header, specify it in the `host` attribute. |
| **scheme** | **Optional.** The readiness check is triggered from inside of your runtime container so no https is required.<br/>If your application requires a https request, set `scheme: https`                                        |

**Example:**

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build: ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly
      # accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the /var/www folder.
      documentRoot: public

      # OPTIONAL. Define a health check with a HTTP GET request option.
      # Configures the check on http://127.0.0.1:80/status
      healthCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /status
```

#### exec

Configures the health check to run a local command.
Following attributes are available:

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **command** | Defines a local command to be run.<br/>The command has access to the same [environment variables](/nginx/how-to/create#set-environment-variables) as your Nginx application.<br/>A single string is required. If you need to run multiple commands create a shell script or, use a multiline format as in the example below. |

**Example:**

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build: ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:

      # accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the /var/www folder.
      documentRoot: public

      # OPTIONAL. Define a health check with a shell command.
      healthCheck:
        exec:
          command: |
            touch grass
            rm -rf life
            mv /outside/user /home/user
```

| **command** | Defines a local command to be run.<br/>The command has access to the same [environment variables](/nginx/how-to/create#set-environment-variables) as your Nginx application.<br/>A single string is required. If you need to run multiple commands create a shell script or, use a multiline format as in the example below. |

**Example:**

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build: ...

    # ==== how to deploy your application ====
    deploy:
      # OPTIONAL. Define a readiness check with a HTTP GET request option.
      # Configures the check on http://127.0.0.1:80/status
      readinessCheck:
        exec:
          command: |
            touch grass
            rm -rf life
            mv /outside/user /home/user
```
