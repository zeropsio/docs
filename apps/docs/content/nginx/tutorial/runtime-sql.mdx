As said, there is no need for coding yet, we have created a [Github repository ↗](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-onboarding-php), a ***recipe***, containing a PostgreSQL service with a simple Nginx application. The repo will be used as a source from which the app will be built.

:::tip
Follow the steps below and when everything is working as expected, fork the repo, try making various changes or be bold and connect your own.
