description: Learn how to access object storage in Zerops.
---

Zerops Object storage is powered by [MinIO](https://min,io), a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. Object storage services are operated on an independent infrastructure separated from your other project services. You can access the object storage from any service hosted in Zerops or remotely over the internet.

## Object storage bucket

Zerops creates one bucket automatically for each new Object storage service.

:::note
Each Object storage service can only contain one bucket. If your application needs multiple buckets, add more Object storage services.
:::

#### Name

Bucket is created with a name based on the selected service name and a random prefix. The name of the bucket cannot be changed later.

#### Access policy

The bucket's access policy was defined when the Object storage service was created. You can [change it] later in Zerops GUI.

#### Quota

The bucket quota size was defined when the Object storage service was created. You can [change it] later in Zerops GUI.

## Copy access details from Zerops GUI

You will find the Object storage access details under the **Access details** button in the project dashboard page.

The same information is available in the service detail page under the **Access & bucket details** menu.

### Object storage access parameters

<table className="w-full my-1.5">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap">Parameter</th>
      <th className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">API URL</td>
      <td>URL of the Object storage service</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">Bucket Name</td>
      <td>Bucket is created with a name based on the selected service name and a random prefix. The name of the bucket is fixed and cannot be changed later.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">Access Key ID</td>
      <td>The S3 Access Key ID</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">Secret Key</td>
      <td>The S3 Secret Key</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Use Object storage environment variables

Zerops creates default environment variables for each Object storage service to help you with connection from any runtime services in the same project. To avoid the need to copy Object storage access parameters manually, use environment variables in your runtime service.

### Prefix the environment variable key

All services of the same project can reference environment variables from other services. To use an environment variable from one service in another service in the same project, you must prefix the environment variable key with the service name and underscore.

#### Example

To access the `bucketName` env variable of the `upload` service, use `upload_bucketName` as the env variable key. To access the `secretAccessKey` env variable of the `storage` service, use `storage_secretAccessKey` as the env variable key.

### Object storage environment variables

List of service environment variables is available in Zerops GUI. Go to an Object storage service detail and choose **Environment variables** in the left menu.

Zerops creates following environment variables when the Object storage service is created:

<table className="w-full my-1.5">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap">Variable</th>
      <th className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">apiUrl</td>
      <td>URL of the Object storage service</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">accessKeyId</td>
      <td>The S3 Access Key ID</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">secretAccessKey</td>
      <td>The S3 Secret Key</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">bucketName</td>
      <td>Bucket is created with a name based on the selected service name and a random prefix. The name of the bucket is fixed and cannot be changed later.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">quotaGBytes</td>
      <td>The bucket quota in GB.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">projectId</td>
      <td>ID of the project. Generated by Zerops.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">serviceId</td>
      <td>ID of the Object storage service. Generated by Zerops.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">hostname</td>
      <td>The name of the Object storage service.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
