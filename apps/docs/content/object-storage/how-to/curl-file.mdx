title: Download file from a private bucket with cURL
---

This guide explains how to download a single file from a private Object Storage bucket using cURL and a bash script with Zerops object storage.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Zerops Object Storage
- Storage credentials (`ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
- Bash environment
- OpenSSL and cURL installed

:::caution
Store your storage credentials securely and never commit them to version control.
:::

## Script

Save this script as `download-storage.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

server="${3:-storage-prg1.zerops.io}"
file_path=$2
bucket=$1
set -eu pipefail

contentType="application/octet-stream"
dateValue=`date -R`
signature_string="GET\n\n${contentType}\n${dateValue}\n/${bucket}/${file_path}"

signature_hash=`echo -en ${signature_string} | openssl sha1 -hmac ${SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} -binary | base64`

curl -sSo ${file_path} \
  -H "Date: ${dateValue}" \
  -H "Content-Type: ${contentType}" \
  -H "Authorization: AWS ${ACCESS_KEY_ID}:${signature_hash}" \
  "https://${server}/${bucket}/${file_path}"

```

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x download-storage.sh
```

2. Set your storage credentials as environment variables:
```bash
export ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
export SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
./download-storage.sh my-bucket file.pdf
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied**: Check your `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- **File Not Found**: Verify bucket name and file path
- **Script Error**: Ensure the script has execute permissions
