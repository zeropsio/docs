[Ubuntu ↗](https://ubuntu.com/) is a popular Linux distribution based on Debian, widely used for servers, cloud computing, and containerized applications.

Ubuntu services in Zerops provide a flexible base environment for running applications built with technologies that aren't officially supported by Zerops, or for custom setups requiring full control over the runtime environment.
