Zerops allows you to stop any service. Stopped services only consume disk.

## Stop, start and restart Elasticsearch service in Zerops GUI

To stop the Elasticsearch service in Zerops GUI go to the project dashboard and select the **Stop** menu item in the top right corner.

**// TODO screenshot (show menu with the start and stop items on a service)**

To start the stopped Elasticsearch service choose the **Start** item from the same menu.

To restart the Elasticsearch service choose the **Restart** item from the same menu.

## Stop and start Elasticsearch using zCLI

zCLI is the Zerops command-line tool. To stop and start the Elasticsearch service via the command-line, follow these steps:

1. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli)
2. Run the `zcli service stop` command

```sh

                           command is to be executed.
