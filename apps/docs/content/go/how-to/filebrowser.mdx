## Zerops GUI

In Zerops GUI, go to the service detail page and choose **Service containers & resources overview** and scroll down to the list of containers.

  <img
    src="/img/screenshots/nodejs_containers_list.png"
    alt="image"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
  />
</p>

Then click on the file browser icon and the file browser opens:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/screenshots/nodejs_file_browser.png"
    alt="image"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
  />

If your service is in the [HA mode], you can switch between containers in the top left corner.

## zCLI & SSH

You can connect to the container via SSH with the Zerops CLI and browse its files.
