title: How to upgrade the Go version
---

You can upgrade or downgrade your Go service to a different major Go version by setting the <a href="/go/how-to/build-pipeline#base-1"><code>run.base</code></a> parameter in your `zerops.yml`. When you [trigger a new pipeline](/go/how-to/trigger-pipeline), Zerops will start new runtime container(s) with the required Go version. If you don't specify the `run.base` attribute in your `zerops.yml`, Zerops keeps the current Go version for your runtime.

If you want to build your application with a different major Go version, change the <a href="/go/how-to/build-pipeline#base"><code>build.base</code></a> parameter in your `zerops.yml`. The `build.base` is the required attribute.
