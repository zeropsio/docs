Valkey is a powerful, open-source alternative to Redis, offering full compatibility with Redis clients while providing an independent development path focused on community-driven innovation. Deploy and manage Valkey in Zerops' fully managed infrastructure to get instant access to high-performance in-memory data storage.

:::tip
Valkey is our recommended Redis alternative as KeyDB's development has slowed significantly in recent times.

## Supported Versions

Currently supported Valkey versions:
<UnorderedList data={data.valkey.readable}/>

Import configuration version:
<UnorderedCodeList data={data.valkey.import}/>

## Service Configuration

Zerops offers Valkey in two deployment configurations to meet different availability requirements.

### Non-HA Setup
- Single node deployment on port `6379` (non-TLS) and `6380` (TLS)
- No backup mechanism beyond Zerops infrastructure reliability
- Data persists unless the hardware node fails
- Suitable for development or non-critical workloads

### HA (High Availability) Setup

Our HA implementation uses a unique approach to ensure high availability while maintaining compatibility with all Redis clients:

- 3-node configuration (1 master + 2 replicas)
- Access ports:
  - `6379` - read/write operations (non-TLS, routed to master)
  - `6380` - read/write operations over TLS (routed to master)
  - `7000` - read-only operations (non-TLS)
  - `7001` - read-only operations over TLS
- Implementation details:
  - All nodes are configured identically and listen on standard ports
  - First node in the cluster is designated as the master
  - On replica nodes, ports `6379`/`6380` traffic is forwarded to the master
  - Ports `7000`/`7001` are mapped locally to each node for direct replica access
  - When a master fails, a replica is promoted and routing is updated automatically
  - DNS entries are updated for seamless client connection
  - This implementation provides traffic forwarding to master (not natively supported by Valkey)

:::note
Be aware that replica data may lag slightly behind the master due to asynchronous replication.
