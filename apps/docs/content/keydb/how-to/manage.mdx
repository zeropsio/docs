## How to use a database management tool on your workstation

Do you already use a database management tool that supports KeyDB on your workstation? Connect it securely to KeyDB from your local workspace via Zerops VPN.

Zerops VPN client is included into zCLI, the Zerops command-line tool. To start the VPN connection, read [how to connect to KeyDB remotely](/keydb/how-to/connect#connect-to-keydb-in-zerops-remotely).

:::caution
Do not use SSL/TLS protocols when connecting to KeyDB over VPN. Zerops KeyDB is not configured to support these protocols. The security is assured by the VPN.

## How to use KeyDB Client CLI on your workstation

If you use the [keydb-cli ↗](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/keydbcli/) command-line client to manage your KeyDB on your local workspace, you can connect it securely to KeyDB via Zerops VPN.

Zerops VPN client is included into zCLI, the Zerops command-line tool. To start the VPN connection, read [how to connect to KeyDB remotely](/keydb/how-to/connect#connect-to-keydb-in-zerops-remotely).

Once the VPN session is established, you have the secured connection to the project's private network in Zerops. You can access all project services locally by using their hostname. The only difference is that no [environment variables](/keydb/how-to/connect#connect-to-keydb-in-zerops-remotely) are available when connected through VPN. To connect to KeyDB in Zerops you have to copy the [access details](/keydb/how-to/connect#connect-to-keydb-in-zerops-remotely) manually from Zerops GUI.

Use `keydb-cli` command to connect to KeyDB in Zerops:

```sh
keydb-cli -h [hostname]
```

:::caution
Do not use SSL/TLS protocols when connecting to KeyDB over VPN. Zerops KeyDB is not configured to support these protocols. The security is assured by the VPN.
