As said, there is no need for coding yet, we have created multiple repositories, **_recipes_**, containing a PostgreSQL service with a simple web application. The repo will be used as a source from which the app will be built.

<CustomCard title="Feel free to deploy a recipe with Keydb" emoji="🚀">
  Laravel Jetstream is an advanced starter kit by Laravel. Zerops recipe for Jetstream
  includes all the advanced functionality — session and cache stored in Redis(Keydb) and files
  stored in Object Storage, this makes it perfectly suitable for production of any size.

2. Click or the `subdomain` URL to open it in a browser and you should see
