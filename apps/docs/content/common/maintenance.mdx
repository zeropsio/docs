Maintenance and operations in Zerops encompass all aspects of running and managing your services after deployment. This includes monitoring performance, managing access, scaling resources, and handling storage and logs. These tools and features help ensure your applications run smoothly and efficiently in production.

## Monitoring & Operations Tools

Zerops provides a comprehensive set of tools for maintaining your services:

* **[Service Dashboard](https://app.zerops.io)** - real-time monitoring of resource usage, scaling events, and service health
* **[Runtime Logs](/common/maintenance/logs)** - detailed logging system for debugging and performance analysis
* **[Resource Analytics](/common/maintenance/scaling)** - insights into scaling patterns and resource utilization
* **[File Management](/common/maintenance/filebrowser)** - direct access to container files for maintenance
