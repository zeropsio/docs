Service configuration in Zerops provides granular control over your runtime environment and application behavior. This includes managing environment variables, customizing runtime environments, and ensuring secure configuration across different deployment stages.

## Core Configuration Areas

  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      href: '/common/configuration/env-variables',
      label: 'Environment Variables',
      customProps: {
        icon: Icons['tools'],
        description:
          'Manage runtime and build-time environment variables, including secrets and service-to-service variable sharing.',
      },
    },
    {
      type: 'link',
      href: '/common/configuration/customize-runtime',
      label: 'Runtime Customization',
      customProps: {
        icon: Icons['adjustments'],
        description:
          'Customize your runtime environment with additional packages, tools, and service-specific configurations.',
      },
    },
