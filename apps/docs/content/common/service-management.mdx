Service management in Zerops encompasses the core operations you can perform on your services throughout their lifecycle. This includes creating new services, controlling their runtime state, upgrading versions, and removing services when they're no longer needed.

## Management Interfaces

Zerops provides two primary interfaces for managing your services:

* **[Zerops GUI](https://app.zerops.io)** - visual interface with intuitive dashboard, real-time updates and integrated help
* **[Zerops CLI (zCLI)](/references/cli)** - command-line tool for service management, supporting both interactive and automated operations
