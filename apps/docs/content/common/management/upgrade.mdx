title: Upgrading a service version
description: Learn how to upgrade your service's version

In Zerops, service version management is handled through two key parameters in your `zerops.yml`:
- `run.base`: Controls the runtime version
- `build.base`: Controls the build environment version (required)

:::note
For a complete list of supported versions for each service, see all currently [supported versions](/zerops-yml/base-list).

## Version Management

Configure your service versions in `zerops.yml`. Here's an example for Node.js service:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: nodejs
    build:
      base: nodejs@18  # Required: Sets build environment version
      build:
        - npm ci
        - npm run build
    run:
      base: nodejs@18  # Optional: Sets runtime version
```

**Note:** If `run.base` is not specified, Zerops maintains the current version. After changing the version in `zerops.yml`, you need to redeploy your application for the changes to take effect. The deployment process will ensure zero-downtime when switching to the new version.

## Best Practices

- Test version changes in development environment first
- Review service's changelog for breaking changes
- Document version changes in your project

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Build fails after version change**
   - Check build logs {/*[build logs](/common/maintenance/logs#build-log)*/} for specific error messages
   - Verify if the error is related to dependencies
   - Roll back to previous version if needed

2. **Application Crashes After Deployment**
   - Check application logs {/*[application logs](/common/maintenance/logs#runtime-log)*/} for runtime errors
   - Verify [environment variables](/features/env-variables) are set correctly
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed
