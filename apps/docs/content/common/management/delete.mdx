```sh

  zcli service delete [serviceIdOrName] [flags]

      --confirm            If set, zCLI will not ask for confirmation of destructive operations.
  -h, --help               the service delete command.
      --projectId string   If you have access to more than one project, you must specify the project ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
      --serviceId string   If you have access to more than one service, you must specify the service ID for which the
