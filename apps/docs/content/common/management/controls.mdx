Zerops allows you to stop any service. Stopped services only consume disk.

## Stop, start and restart service in Zerops GUI

The following actions can be performed from the project dashboard using the menu in the top right corner:

* **Stop service**: Select the **Stop** menu item
* **Start service**: Select the **Start** menu item for any stopped service
* **Restart service**: Select the **Restart** menu item

## Stop and start using zCLI

zCLI is the Zerops command-line tool. To stop and start the service via the command-line, follow these steps:

1. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli) if needed
2. Run the `zcli service stop` command

```sh
Usage:
  zcli service stop [serviceIdOrName] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help               the enable Zerops subdomain command.
      --projectId string   If you have access to more than one project, you must specify the project ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
      --serviceId string   If you have access to more than one service, you must specify the service ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
```
