Build and deployment in Zerops encompasses the entire process from configuring your build pipeline to deploying your application in production. This includes setting up your build environment, managing the build process, handling deployments, and triggering builds through various methods.

## Pipeline Interfaces

Zerops offers multiple ways to trigger and manage your build & deploy pipeline:

* **[GitHub/GitLab Integration](https://app.zerops.io)** - automatic builds and deploys triggered by repository events
* **[Zerops CLI (zCLI)](/references/cli)** - command-line tool for manual builds and deployments
* **[Zerops GUI](https://app.zerops.io)** - visual interface for monitoring and managing pipelines
