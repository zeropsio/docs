# Quick Start

This quick start shows how to get an existing Node.js application up and running easily. If you are interested in more detailed guides for your own application, head to the [How to](/nodejs/how-to/create) section.

No need for coding now, we have created a [Github repository ↗](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-es-nodejs-basic) containing a very simple Node.js application using Elasticsearch as a data storage.

:::tip
Follow the steps below and when everything is working as expected, fork the repo, try making various changes or be bold and connect your own.
:::

1. In <a href="https://app.zerops.io">Zerops GUI</a> create a project called `my-project`.

</details>
2. In the left menu, click on **Import services**, copy & paste the contents of this [yaml file ↗](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-es-nodejs-basic?tab=readme-ov-file#zerops-import-syntax) and click on **Import service**.
3. Two pipelines are created, one for project creation and one for the service activation. Wait for both to finish.
4. In the service detail, open the **Public access & internal ports** section, and **Enable Zerops Subdomain**.
5. Once the pipeline finishes, open the activated subdomain URL in your browser - you should see a simple page with _Hello! A new document was inserte dinto Elasticsearch!_.
