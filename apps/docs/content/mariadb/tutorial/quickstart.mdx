As said, there is no need for coding yet, we have created multiple repositories, **_recipes_**, containing a PostgreSQL service with a simple web application. The repo will be used as a source from which the app will be built.

1. Log in/sign up to [Zerops GUI â†—](https://app.zerops.io)
2. Choose a recipe based on your desired technology and copy the content of the yaml config in a `README` file
3. In Zerops GUI, in the **Projects** box click on **Import a project** and paste the config.
4. Click on **Import project** and wait until all pipelines have finished.

**That's it, your application is now up and running! :star: Let's check it works:**

1. A _subdomain_ should have been enabled and visible in the project's **IP addressed & Public Routing Overview** box. Its format should look similar to this `https://golang1-24-8080.prg1.zerops.app`.
2. Click on the `subdomain` URL to open it in a browser and you should see:

```
Entry added successfully with random data: f47ac10b-58cc-0372-8567-0e02b2c3d479. Total count: 1
```
