Zerops provides automated data backup for MariaDB services with full encryption and flexible management options.

For general backup information including configuration, scheduling, and management options, see the [Zerops Backups](/features/backup) documentation, which covers:
- Backup scheduling and retention policies
- Tagging system and storage quotas
- Manual backup creation and CLI tools
- Security and encryption details

This page focuses on MariaDB-specific backup details.

## MariaDB Backup Format

MariaDB backups are created using `mariabackup` and stored in `.xb.gz` format:

- **Format**: `.xb.gz` (single archive)
- **Tooling**: `mariabackup`
- **Compression**: Uses `xbstream` format, gzip compressed
- **Storage**: Encrypted and stored in isolated object storage

## Restoring MariaDB Backups

To restore a MariaDB backup:

1. **Download** the backup file (`.xb.gz`) from the Zerops UI
2. **Prepare** your target environment (clean existing data or use a new instance)
3. **Extract** the backup file to access the database contents
4. **Restore** using either:
   - **MariaDB native tools**: Follow the [official MariaDB backup documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariabackup/) for detailed restore procedures
   - **Third-party management tools**: Use web-based tools like phpMyAdmin or Adminer as described in [MariaDB Management Tools](/mariadb/how-to/manage)

For assistance with the restoration process, contact Zerops support.

## High Availability

For MariaDB services running in High Availability mode:
- Backups are created on a randomly selected healthy node
- Other nodes remain operational during the backup process
- Manual backups typically run on the primary node

## Best Practices

- Always create a manual backup with a protected tag before database migrations or major schema changes
- Test your restore process periodically in a non-production environment
- Monitor your backup storage usage in the Project Overview
- Use descriptive tags like `pre-migration-v2` for important snapshots

For additional best practices and troubleshooting, refer to the [main backup documentation](/features/backup).
