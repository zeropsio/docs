Zerops provides a customizable build and runtime environment for your PHP application.

## Add zerops.yml to your repository

Start by adding `zerops.yml` file to the **root of your repository** and modify it to fit your application:

```yml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Set the base technology for the build environment:
      base: php-apache@latest

      # OPTIONAL. Set the operating system for the build environment.
      # os: ubuntu

      # OPTIONAL. Customise the build environment by installing additional packages
      # or tools to the base build environment.
      # prepareCommands:
      #   - apt-get something
      #   - curl something else

      # OPTIONAL. Build your application
      buildCommands:
        - composer install

      # REQUIRED. Select which files / folders to deploy after
      # the build has successfully finished
      deployFiles:
        - vendor
        - public

      # OPTIONAL. Which files / folders you want to cache for the next build.
      # Next builds will be faster when the cache is used.
      # cache: vendor

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Sets the base technology for the runtime environment:
      base: php-apache@latest

      # OPTIONAL. Customise the runtime PHP environment by installing additional
      # dependencies to the base PHP runtime environment.
      # prepareCommands:
      #   - apt-get something
      #   - curl something else

      # OPTIONAL. Run one or more commands each time a new runtime container
      # is started or restarted. These commands are triggered before
      # your PHP application is started.
      # init:
      #  - rm -rf ./cache

      # OPTIONAL. Customise the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly
      # accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the /var/www folder.
      documentRoot: public

      # OPTIONAL. Sets the custom Nginx or Apache configuration. The file must be deployed in
      # the runtime container. Enter the path to the file relative to the /var/www folder
      siteConfigPath: site_config.tmpl
```

The top-level element is always `zerops`.

### Setup

The first element `setup` contains the **hostname** of your service. A runtime service with the same hostname must exist in Zerops.
Zerops supports the definition of multiple runtime services in a single `zerops.yml`. This is useful when you use a monorepo. Just add multiple setup elements in your `zerops.yml`:

```yml
zerops:
  # definition for app service
  - setup: app
    build: ...
    run: ...

  # definition for api service
  - setup: api
    build: ...
    run: ...
```

Each service configuration contains at least two sections: **build** and **run**. Both sections are required to build and deploy your PHP application in Zerops. If you'd like to use a readiness check, add an optional **deploy** section.

## Build pipeline configuration

### base

_REQUIRED._ Sets the base technology for the build environment.

Following options are available for PHP builds:

<UnorderedCodeList data={data.phpVersions} />

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base: php-apache@latest
      ...
```

<p>
  The base build environment contains {data.alpineCurrentVersion}, the selected
  major version of PHP, <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a>,{' '}
  `composer`, `git` and `wget`.
</p>

:::info
You can change the base environment when you need to. Just simply modify the `zerops.yml` in your repository.
:::

If you need to install more technologies to the build environment, set multiple values as a yaml array. For example:

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base:
        - php-apache@latest
        - go@latest
      ...
```

See the full list of supported [build base environments](/references/zeropsyml/base-list#php).

To customise your build environment use the [prepareCommands](/php/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands) attribute.

### os

_OPTIONAL._ Sets the operating system for the build environment.

Following options are available:

- `alpine`
- `ubuntu`

Default value is `alpine`.

We are currently using following os version:

- <span>{data.alpineCurrentVersion}</span>
- <span>{data.ubuntuCurrentVersion}</span>

:::caution
The os version is fixed and cannot be customised.
:::

### prepareCommands

_OPTIONAL._ Customises the build environment by installing additional dependencies or tools to the base build environment.

The base build environment contains:

- <span>{data.alpineCurrentVersion}</span>
- selected version of PHP defined in the [base](/php/how-to/build-pipeline#base) attribute
- [Zerops command line tool](/references/cli)
- `composer`, `git` and `wget`

To install additional packages or tools add one or more prepare commands:

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Set the base technology for the build environment:
      base: php-apache@latest

      # OPTIONAL. Customise the build environment by installing additional packages
      # or tools to the base build environment.
      prepareCommands:
        - apt-get something
        - curl something else
      ...
```

When the first build is triggered, Zerops will

1. create a build container
2. download your application code from your repository
3. run the prepare commands in the defined order

The application code is available in the `/var/www` folder in your build container before the prepare commands are triggered. This allows you to use any file from your application code in your prepare commands (e.g. a configuration file).

#### Command exit code

If any command fails, it returns an exit code other than 0 and the build is canceled. Read the [build log](/php/how-to/logs#build-log) to troubleshoot the error. If the command ends successfully, it returns the exit code 0 and Zerops triggers the following command. When all prepare commands are finished, your custom build environment is ready for the build phase.

#### Single or separated shell instances

You can configure your prepare commands to be run in a single shell instance or multiple shell instances. The format is identical to [build commands](#buildcommands).

#### Cache of your custom build environment

Some packages or tools can take a long time to install. Therefore, Zerops caches your custom build environment after each successful build where the prepare commands were used. When the second or following build is triggered, Zerops will use the build cache from the previous build if both following conditions are met:

1. Content of the base and prepare attributes didn't change from the previous build
2. The build cache wasn't invalidated in the Zerops GUI.

To invalidate the Zerops build cache go to your service detail in Zerops GUI, choose **Service dashboard & runtime containers** from the left menu and click on the **Open pipeline detail** button. Then click on the **Invalidate build cache** icon.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/screenshots/runtime_clear_build_cache.png"
    alt="image"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
  />
</p>

When the build cache is used, Zerops doesn't run the `prepareCommands` commands and the build of your application is faster.

### buildCommands

_REQUIRED._ Defines build commands.

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Set the base technology for the build environment:
      base: php-apache@latest

      # REQUIRED. Build your application
      buildCommands:
        - composer install
      ...
```

At least one command is required. Zerops triggers each command in the defined order in a dedicated build container.

Before the build commands are triggered the build container contains:

1. base environment defined by the [base](/php/how-to/build-pipeline#base) attribute
2. optional customisation of the base environment defined in the [prepareCommands](/php/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands) attribute
3. your application code

#### Run build commands as a single shell instance

Use following syntax to run all commands in the same environment context. For example, if one command changes the current directory, the next command continues in that directory. When one command creates an environment variable, the next command can access it.

```yml
buildCommands:
  - |
    composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
    php artisan env
```

#### Run build commands as a separate shell instances

When the following syntax is used, each command is triggered in a separate environment context. For example, each shell instance starts in the home directory again. When one command creates an environment variable, it won't be available for the next command.

```yml
buildCommands:
  - composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
  - php artisan env
```

#### Command exit code

If any command fails, it returns an exit code other than 0 and the build is canceled. Read the [build log](/php/how-to/logs#build-log) to troubleshoot the error. If the error log doesn't contain any specific error message, try to run your build with the verbose option.

```yml
buildCommands:
  - composer install -v
```

If the command ends successfully, it returns the exit code 0 and Zerops triggers the following command. When all `buildCommands` are finished, the application build is completed and ready for the [deploy](/php/how-to/build-pipeline#deployFiles) phase.

### deployFiles

_REQUIRED._ Selects which files or folders will be deployed after the build has successfully finished. To filter out specific files or folders, use <a href="#deployignore">`.deployignore`</a> file.

```yml
# REQUIRED. Select which files / folders to deploy after
# the build has successfully finished
deployFiles:
  - vendor
  - public
```

Determines files or folders produced by your build, which should be deployed to your runtime service containers.

The path starts from the **root directory** of your project (the location of `zerops.yml`). You must enclose the name in quotes if the folder or the file name contains a space.

#### Examples

Deploys a folder, and a file from the project root directory:

```yml
deployFiles:
  - public
  - file.txt
```

Deploys the whole content of the build container:

```yml
deployFiles: .
```

Deploys a folder, and a file in a defined path:

```yml
deployFiles:
  - ./path/to/file.txt
  - ./path/to/dir/
```

#### How to use a wildcard in the path

Zerops supports the `~` character as a wildcard for one or more folders in the path.

Deploys all `file.txt` files that are located in any path that begins with `/path/` and ends with `/to/`

```yml
deployFiles: ./path/~/to/file.txt
```

Deploys all folders that are located in any path that begins with `/path/to/`

```yml
deployFiles: ./path/to/~/
```

Deploys all folders that are located in any path that begins with `/path/` and ends with `/to/`

```yml
deployFiles: ./path/~/to/
```

#### .deployignore

Add a `.deployignore` file to the root of your project and specify which files and folders Zerops should ignore during deploy. The syntax is the same as of a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format">`.gitignore`</a> file.

Example to ignore `src/file.txt` file in deploy:

```jsx title="zerops.yml"
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      deployFiles: ./
```

```jsx title=".deployignore"
src / file.txt;
```

:::note
`.deployignore` file also works with <a href="/references/cli/commands#deploy">`zcli service deploy`</a> command.
:::

### cache

_OPTIONAL._ Defines which files or folders will be cached for the next build.

```yml
# OPTIONAL. Which files / folders you want to cache for the next build.
# Next builds will be faster when the cache is used.
cache: vendor
```

By default, Zerops doesn't cache the files in the build container. When the build phase is finished, the files and folders defined in the [deployFiles](#deployfiles) attribute are saved and deployed to your runtime containers. Then, the build container is deleted.
To speed the second and following build up, cache the files that can be used in the next build. We recommend caching the `vendor` directory.

The cache attribute supports the [~ wildcard character](#how-to-use-a-wildcard-in-the-path).

### envVariables

_OPTIONAL._ Defines the environment variables for the build environment.

Enter one or more env variables in following format:

```yml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      base: php-apache@latest
        …

      # OPTIONAL. Defines the env variables for the build environment:
      envVariables:
        PHP_ENV: production
        DB_NAME: db
        DB_HOST: db
        DB_USER: db
        DB_PASS: ${db_password}
```

Read more about [environment variables](/php/how-to/env-variables) in Zerops.

## Runtime configuration

### base

_OPTIONAL._ Sets the base technology for the runtime environment.
If you don't specify the `run.base` attribute, Zerops keeps the current PHP version for your runtime.

Following options are available for PHP builds:

<UnorderedCodeList data={data.phpVersions} />

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base: php-apache@latest
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Sets the base technology for the runtime environment:
        base: php-apache@latest
      ...
```

<p>
  The base runtime environment contains {data.alpineCurrentVersion}, the
  selected major version of PHP,{' '}
  <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a> and{' '}
  `composer`, `git` and `wget`.
</p>

:::info
You can change the base environment when you need to. Just simply modify the `zerops.yml` in your repository.
:::

If you need to install more technologies to the runtime environment, set multiple values as a yaml array. For example:

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      # REQUIRED. Sets the base technology for the build environment:
      base: php-apache@latest
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Sets the base technology for the runtime environment:
      base:
        - php-apache@latest
        - golang@latest
      ...
```

See the full list of supported [run base environments](/references/zeropsyml/base-list).

To customise your build environment use the `prepareCommands` attribute.

### os

_OPTIONAL._ Sets the operating system for the runtime environment.

Following options are available:

- `alpine`
- `ubuntu`

Default value is `alpine`.

We are currently using following os version:

- <span>{data.alpineCurrentVersion}</span>
- <span>{data.ubuntuCurrentVersion}</span>

:::caution
The os version is fixed and cannot be customised.
:::

### ports

_OPTIONAL._ Specifies one or more internal ports on which your application will listen.

:::info
If no ports are specified, Zerops adds the port TCP 80 automatically.
:::

:::caution
If you want the web server to listen on other port(s) than `:80`, you must [customize](/php/how-to/build-pipeline#customize-web-server) your web server configuration as well.
:::

Projects in Zerops represent a group of one or more services. Services can be of different types (runtime services, databases, message brokers, object storage, etc.). All services of the same project share a **dedicated private network**. To connect to a service within the same project, just use the service hostname and its internal port.

For example, to connect to a PHP service with hostname = "app" and port = 80 from another service of the same project, simply use `app:80`. Read more about [how to access a PHP service](/php/how-to/access).

:::info
Do not use the port **:443**. All the incoming traffic is terminated on the Zerops internal balancer where the SSL certificate is installed and the request is forwarded to your PHP+Nginx / PHP+Apache service as a **http://** on the port **:80**.
:::

Each port has following attributes:

| parameter   | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| port        | Defines the port number. You can set any port number between _10_ and _65435_. Ports outside this interval are reserved for internal Zerops systems.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| protocol    | **Optional.** Defines the protocol. Allowed values are `TCP` or `UDP`. Default value is `TCP`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| httpSupport | **Optional.** `httpSupport = true` is the default setting for TCP protocol. Set `httpSupport = false` if a web server isn't running on the port. Zerops uses this information for the configuration of [public access](/features/access). `httpSupport = true` is available only in combination with the TCP protocol. |

### prepareCommands

_OPTIONAL._ Customises the PHP runtime environment by installing additional dependencies or tools to the runtime base environment.

<p>
  The base PHP environment contains {data.alpineCurrentVersion}, the selected
  major version of PHP, <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a>{' '}
  and `composer`, `git` and `wget`. To install
  additional packages or tools add one or more prepare commands:
</p>

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the runtime environment by installing additional packages
      # or tools to the base PHP runtime environment.
      prepareCommands:
        - apt-get something
        - curl something else
      ...
```

When the first deploy with a defined prepare attribute is triggered, Zerops will

1. create a prepare runtime container
2. optionally: [copy selected folders or files from your build container](/php/how-to/build-pipeline#copy-folders-or-files-from-your-build-container)
3. run the `prepareCommands` commands in the defined order

#### Command exit code

If any command fails, it returns an exit code other than 0 and the deploy is canceled. Read the [prepare runtime log](/php/how-to/logs#prepare-runtime-log) to troubleshoot the error. If the command ends successfully, it returns the exit code 0 and Zerops triggers the following command. When all `prepareCommands` commands are finished, your custom runtime environment is ready for the deploy phase.

#### Cache of your custom runtime environment

Some packages or tools can take a long time to install. Therefore, Zerops caches your custom runtime environment after the installation of your custom packages or tools is completed. When the second or following deploy is triggered, Zerops will use the custom runtime cache from the previous deploy if following conditions are met:

1. Content of the [build.addToRunPrepare](#copy-folders-or-files-from-your-build-container) and `run.prepareCommands` attributes didn't change from the previous deploy
2. The custom runtime cache wasn't invalidated in the Zerops GUI.

To invalidate the Zerops custom runtime cache go to `yyy`

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/screenshots/runtime_clear_build_cache.png"
    alt="image"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
  />
</p>

When the prepare cache is used, Zerops doesn't create a prepare runtime container and executes the deployment of your application directly.

#### Single or separated shell instances

You can configure your prepare commands to be run in a single shell instance or multiple shell instances. The format is identical to [build commands](#buildcommands).

### Copy folders or files from your build container

<p>
  The prepare runtime container contains {data.alpineCurrentVersion}, the
  selected major version of PHP,{' '}
  <a href="/references/cli">Zerops command line tool</a> and{' '}
  `composer`, `git` and `wget`.
</p>

The prepare runtime container does not contain your application code nor the built application. If you need to copy some folders or files from the build container to the runtime container (e.g. a configuration file) use the `addToRunPrepare` attribute in the [build section](#build-pipeline-configuration).

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
      ...
      addToRunPrepare: ./runtime-config.yml

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the runtime environment by installing additional packages
      # or tools to the base PHP runtime environment.
      prepareCommands:
        - apt-get something
        - curl something else
      ...
```

In the example above Zerops will copy the `runtime-config.yml` file from your build container **after the build has finished** into the new **prepare runtime** container. The copied files and folders will be available in the `xxx` folder in the new prepare runtime container before the prepare commands are triggered.

### initCommands

_OPTIONAL._ Defines one or more commands to be run each time a new runtime container is started or a container is restarted.

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build: ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Run one or more commands each time a new runtime container
      # is started or restarted. These commands are triggered before
      # your PHP application is started.
      initCommands:
        - rm -rf ./cache
```

These commands are triggered in the runtime container before your PHP application is started.

Use init commands to clean or initialise your application cache or similar operations.

:::caution
The init commands will delay the start of your application each time a new runtime container is started (including the [horizontal scaling](/php/how-to/scaling#horizontal-scaling) or when a runtime container is restarted.

Do not use the init commands for customising your runtime environment. Use the [run:prepareCommands](/php/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands-1) attribute instead.
:::

#### Command exit code

If any of the `initCommands` fails, it returns an exit code other than 0, but deploy is **not** canceled. After all init commands are finished, regardless of the status code, the application is started. Read the [runtime log](/php/how-to/logs#runtime-log) to troubleshoot the error.

#### Single or separated shell instances

You can configure your `initCommands` to be run in a single shell instance or multiple shell instances. The format is identical to [build commands](#buildcommands).

### documentRoot

_OPTIONAL._ Customizes the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly accessible web server content.

:::info
By default, the document root is configured to `/var/www`.
:::

Customize the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the `/var/www` folder.
E.g. `documentRoot: public` will set the web server document root to `/var/www/public`.

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build: ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly
      # accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the /var/www folder.
      documentRoot: public
```

### siteConfigPath

_OPTIONAL._ Sets the custom Nginx or Apache configuration.

:::info
By default, the default [nginx](/php/how-to/customize-web-server#default-nginx-configuration) or [Apache](/php/how-to/customize-web-server#default-apache-configuration) web server configuration is set.
:::

The file must be deployed in the runtime container. Enter the path to the file relative to the `/var/www` folder.
Read more about the [web server customization](/php/how-to/customize-web-server).

### envVariables

_OPTIONAL._ Defines the environment variables for the runtime environment.

Enter one or more env variables in following format:

```yml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Defines the env variables for the runtime environment:
      envVariables:
        PHP_ENV: production
        DB_NAME: db
        DB_HOST: db
        DB_USER: db
        DB_PASS: ${db_password}
```

Read more about [environment variables](/php/how-to/env-variables) in Zerops.

### health check

_OPTIONAL._ Defines a health check.

`healthCheck` requires either one `httpGet` object or one `exec` object.

#### httpGet

Configures the health check to request a local URL using a HTTP GET method.

Following attributes are available:

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **port**   | Defines the port of the HTTP GET request.<br/>The readiness check will trigger a GET request on `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/{path}`                                                                                           |
| **path**   | Defines the URL path of the HTTP GET request.<br/>The readiness check will trigger a GET request on `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/{path}`                                                                                       |
| **host**   | **Optional.** The readiness check is triggered from inside of your runtime container so it always uses the localhost (`127.0.0.1`). If you need to add a `host` to the request header, specify it in the `host` attribute. |
| **scheme** | **Optional.** The readiness check is triggered from inside of your runtime container so no https is required.<br/>If your application requires a https request, set `scheme: https`                                        |

**Example:**

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build: ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly
      # accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the /var/www folder.
      documentRoot: public

      # OPTIONAL. Define a health check with a HTTP GET request option.
      # Configures the check on http://127.0.0.1:80/status
      healthCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /status
```

#### exec

Configures the health check to run a local command.
Following attributes are available:

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **command** | Defines a local command to be run.<br/>The command has access to the same [environment variables](/php/how-to/create#set-environment-variables) as your PHP application.<br/>A single string is required. If you need to run multiple commands create a shell script or, use a multiline format as in the example below. |

**Example:**

```yml
zerops:
  # hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build: ...

    # ==== how to run your application ====
    run:
      # OPTIONAL. Customise the folder that will be used as the root of the publicly
      # accessible web server content. Enter the path relative to the /var/www folder.
      documentRoot: public

      # OPTIONAL. Define a health check with a shell command.
      healthCheck:
        exec:
          command: |
            touch grass
            rm -rf life
            mv /outside/user /home/user
