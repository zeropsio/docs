description: Learn how you can customise your php runtime environment on Zerops.

import data from '@site/static/data.json';

The default PHP runtime environment contains:

- <span>{data.alpineCurrentVersion}</span>
- Selected version of PHP when the runtime service was created
- [zCLI](/references/cli)
- Git and Composer

:::note
To use Ubuntu instead of the default Alpine, set the [run.os](/references/zeropsyml#os-optional-1) attribute.

Additional packages and tools can be installed using [run.prepareCommands](/references/zeropsyml#preparecommands-optional-1).

## Runtime Flow

</p>

When the first deploy with a defined `prepareCommands` attribute is triggered, Zerops will

1. Create a prepare runtime container
2. Optionally: [copy selected folders or files from your build container](/php/how-to/build-pipeline#copy-folders-or-files-from-your-build-container)
3. Run the [run.prepareCommands](/references/zeropsyml#preparecommands-optional-1) commands in the defined order

## Command exit code

Failed commands return non-zero exit codes and cancel deployment. Check [prepare runtime logs](/php/how-to/logs#prepare-runtime-log) for errors. 

Successful commands return exit code 0, triggering the next command. After all prepareCommands complete, the runtime environment is ready for deployment.

The prepare runtime container is deleted once the phase completes or fails.

## Custom runtime environment cache

Some packages or tools can take a long time to install. Therefore, Zerops caches your custom runtime environment after the installation of your custom packages or tools is completed. When the second or following deploy is triggered, Zerops will use the custom runtime cache from the previous deploy if following conditions are met:

1. Content of the <a href="/php/how-to/build-pipeline#copy-folders-or-files-from-your-build-container">build.addToRunPrepare</a> and <a href="/php/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands-1">run.prepareCommands</a> attributes didn't change from the previous deploy
2. The custom runtime cache wasn't invalidated in the Zerops GUI.

### Clearing Zerops runtime cache

1. Go to service detail
2. Select "Service dashboard & runtime containers"
3. Click "Open pipeline detail" 
4. Click "Clear runtime prepare cache"

When the custom runtime cache is used, Zerops doesn't create a prepare runtime container and executes the deployment of your application directly.
