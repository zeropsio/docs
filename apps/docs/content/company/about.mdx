## Our Story

Zerops, originally founded in 2018, began as an internal project at [vshosting.eu](https://vshosting.eu), one of the largest providers of managed hosting solutions in Central Europe. In June 2024, after a period when the project had been shut down following corporate restructuring, Zerops was re-launched as an independent startup. Now headed by the original development team and backed by strong partners, Zerops continues its mission with renewed focus and independence.

## Technology & Infrastructure

Zerops runs on bare metal, with the platform built from the ground up using Golang and [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) containerization. Our servers are currently located in Prague, Czech Republic, leveraging vshosting's state-of-the-art datacenter facilities.

## Financial Backing & Partners

Zerops is financially backed by established venture capital firms:
- [Presto Ventures](https://www.prestoventures.com/) - A leading Central European venture capital firm
- [Gi21 Capital](https://gi21capital.com/) - A technology-focused investment firm

Our primary infrastructure partner is [vshosting.eu](https://vshosting.eu), which itself is part of [Contabo](https://contabo.com/en/), owned by global investment firm [KKR](https://www.kkr.com/). This strategic partnership provides Zerops with enterprise-grade infrastructure stability.

## Looking Ahead

We're committed to continually improving the Zerops platform with a focus on:

- **Multiregional Deployment**: Beginning with built-in CDN capabilities, followed by the ability to run entire projects in different regions
- **Enhanced Performance**: Ongoing optimization of our container orchestration and resource management
- **Developer Experience**: Continuous improvement of our UI, CLI, and API interfaces
