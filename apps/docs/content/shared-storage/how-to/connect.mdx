This page covers how to connect an existing shared storage to runtime services and how to disconnect services when needed.

## In Zerops GUI

### Connect a new shared storage

When creating a new shared storage service, you can directly select which runtime services it should be connected to. See [Create Shared Storage](/shared-storage/how-to/create) for details about the creation process.

### Connect an existing shared storage

For existing storage, go to the shared storage service detail page and select **Shared storage connections**. Toggle ON any runtime services you wish to connect to this storage.

## Disconnect a shared storage in Zerops GUI

To disconnect storage, access the shared storage service detail page, select **Shared storage connections**, and toggle OFF the desired runtime service.

## Connect using zsc

Connect shared storage from the command line with the `zsc connectSharedStorage` command. Specify one or more storage names as parameters:

```sh
zsc connectSharedStorage sharedstorage0
zsc connectSharedStorage sharedDisk secondDisk
```

Run this command from within your runtime container via web terminal, SSH, or in your `zerops.yaml` file. For more details, see the [Zerops Setup Control documentation](/references/zsc).*/}
