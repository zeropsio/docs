Shared Storage provides persistent file storage that can be mounted as a POSIX-compatible filesystem to your runtime services. Built on [SeaweedFS â†—](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs), it enables reliable data persistence and sharing across services in your infrastructure.

## Create Using Zerops GUI

First, set up a project in Zerops GUI and add a runtime service. Then go to the project dashboard page and choose **Add new service** in the left menu in the **Services** block. Then add a new Shared Storage service:

<Video
  src="/vids/services/shared-storage.webm"
  type="video/webm"
/>

### Set a Hostname

Enter a unique service identifier like "storage", "files" etc. Duplicate services with the same name in the same project are forbidden.

#### Hostname Limitations:

- Maximum 25 characters
- Must contain only lowercase ASCII letters (a-z) or numbers (0-9)

:::note
The hostname is fixed after the service is created. It can't be changed later.
:::

### Connect to Services

Select one or more project's runtime services in the Share with Services block:

  <img
    src="/img/screenshots/connect_shared_storage.png"
    alt="image"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
  />
</p>

The new Shared Storage will be connected to the selected runtimes.

:::note
Runtime services can be connected and disconnected at any time even after the shared storage is created.
:::

### Choose Deployment Mode

Choose between **Highly Available** (recommended for production) or **Single Container** (suitable for development) deployment.

:::warning
The Shared Storage deployment mode is fixed after the service is created. It can't be changed later.

See [Technical Details](/shared-storage/technical-details#deployment-modes) for more information about deployment modes.
:::

### Set Auto Scaling Configuration

Configure vertical auto scaling parameters to control resource allocation and costs.

    width="100%"

  />
</p>

:::note
For detailed information about auto scaling capabilities and recommendations, see [Technical Details](/shared-storage/technical-details#auto-scaling-configuration).

## Create Using zCLI

zCLI is the Zerops command-line tool. To create a new Shared Storage service via the command-line, follow these steps:

1. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli)
2. Create a project description file
3. Create a project with a runtime and a Shared Storage service

### Choose Your Runtime
