Zerops provides built-in backup functionality for your Shared Storage service. For general information about configuring backups, viewing backup files, limits, and security, please refer to the [general backup documentation](/features/backup).

Shared Storage backups on Zerops:
- Are stored as tarballs containing the entire contents of the shared storage directory (`/mnt/<volume>`)
- Can be managed through the Shared Storage service detail page under **Backups List & Configuration**

### Storage Optimization

For large Shared Storage volumes:
- Be mindful of the [project backup limits](/features/backup#limits) (25 GiB total backup volume per project)
- Consider adjusting your backup frequency for optimal storage usage
- Regularly clean up unnecessary files from your Shared Storage to reduce backup size
