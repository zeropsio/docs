Zerops provides automated data backup for Shared Storage services with full encryption and flexible management options.

For general backup information including configuration, scheduling, and management options, see the [Zerops Backups](/features/backup) documentation, which covers:
- Backup scheduling and retention policies
- Tagging system and storage quotas
- Manual backup creation and CLI tools
- Security and encryption details

## Shared Storage Backup Format

Shared Storage backups are created using tar archival:

- **Format**: `.tar.gz` (archive of directory contents)
- **Tooling**: `tar`
- **Content**: Compresses the entire shared volume (`/mnt/<volume>`)
- **Storage**: Encrypted and stored in isolated object storage

### Restoring Backups

To restore a Shared Storage backup: Download the backup file (`.tar.gz`) from the Zerops UI, extract the archive, and upload the contents back to your Shared Storage.

## Best Practices

For Shared Storage backups:
- Regularly clean up unnecessary files from your Shared Storage to reduce backup size
- Create manual backups with protected tags before major file operations or migrations
- Consider adjusting your backup frequency for optimal storage usage
- Test your restore process periodically to ensure data integrity

For additional best practices and troubleshooting, refer to the [main backup documentation](/features/backup).
