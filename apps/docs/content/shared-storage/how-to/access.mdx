description: Learn how to use shared storage on Zerops.

Once a shared storage is [connected](/shared-storage/how-to/connect) to a runtime service, Zerops will create a new folder `/mnt/[shared storage name]` in the runtime root folder.

E.g. `/mnt/teststorage` for a `teststorage` shared storage:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/screenshots/connect_shared_storage_2.png"
    alt="image"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
  />
</p>

:::note
The content of this folder is shared among all containers of the connected runtime service.

If you connect multiple runtimes, the content of the folder will be shared among all containers of these services.
:::

#### Example
To make sure your file e.g. `config.txt` is persisted, connect your runtime service to shared storage and save the file anywhere in the `/mnt/[shared storage name]` folder, e.g. `/mnt/[shared storage name]/config/config.txt`.
