title: Using Zerops VPN
description: Interacting with zerops services via zcli cli with wireguard vpn.
---

## Prerequisites

- [zCLI](/references/cli) (this will work as a wireguard client)
- Zerops Project with a Service

At Zerops, We really care about your security so we tried our best to provide you
the best resources and tools to interact with your project deployed on Zerops securely.

Zerops uses WireGuard VPN, but unlike typical consumer VPNs focused on changing
your public IP address, our implementation is specifically designed to securely connect you
to your project.

## How do we provide better security?

We are using wireguard under the hood of vpn to have a secure tunnel connection
to a private network of zerops project which keeps your connection safe compared to SSH.

Wireguard is a free lightweight open source software well technically a communication protcol
which utilizes cryptography as well. It helps us to create a secure tunnel which uses udp for
passing the traffic.

We are using public/private key pairs for authorization.

--------

Inside Zerops project runs a Wireguard server and zCLI(Zerops Command Line Interface) works as
a Wireguard client which helps you to interact with your zerops project if you're authorized.

## Start the VPN

Start a VPN session with:

```sh
zcli vpn up
```

```sh title="bash"
Usage:
  zcli vpn up [projectId] [flags]

Flags:
      --auto-disconnect    If set, zCLI will automatically disconnect from the VPN if it is already connected.
  -h, --help               the vpn up command.
      --projectId string   If you have access to more than one project, you must specify the project ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
```

Or connect to a specfic project by passing your project ID into the `projectId` parameter:

```sh
zcli vpn up Evs8Je4NTvKeIkUqoUXp2w
```

You may need enclose your project name with quotes if it contains contains spaces.

:::info
When running `zcli vpn up` for the first time, you'll be prompted to install the Zerops VPN daemon. Enter `y` to confirm (you may need to provide your root/administrator password).
:::

Once connected, you’ll have secure access to the project’s private network.

You can reach all services locally using their hostnames. However, environment variables are not available when connected via VPN.

You can only connect to one project at a time. If you’re already connected to another project, that connection will close automatically when you start a new one.

The VPN daemon keeps the connection open until you manually stop it. If the connection drops, it will automatically try to reconnect.

## Stop the VPN

Use `zcli vpn down` command to stop the existing VPN session.

```sh title="bash"
Usage:
  zcli vpn down [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   the vpn down command.
```
