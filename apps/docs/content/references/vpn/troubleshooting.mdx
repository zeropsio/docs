# VPN Troubleshooting Guide

## 1. Interface Already Exists
**Problem**: When running `zcli vpn up`, you get an error like:
```
ERR /opt/homebrew/bin/wg-quick up /opt/homebrew/etc/wireguard/zerops.conf: [+] Interface for zerops is utun6 wg-quick: 'zerops' already exists as 'utun6'
```

**Solution**: Reset the VPN connection by running:
```bash
zcli vpn down
zcli vpn up
```

## 2. Hostname Resolution
**Problem**: Even with VPN successfully connected, hostname resolution fails with errors like:
```
could not translate host name "hostname" to address: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

* The issue is known to happen rarely on Windows

**Solution**: Append `.zerops` to the hostname, even when VPN shows as connected:
```bash
# Instead of
psql -h [hostname] -U [user]

# Use
psql -h [hostname].zerops -U [user]
```

:::tip Windows OS tip
In the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog, navigate to the DNS tab and confirm that "zerops" appears in the "Append these DNS suffixes (in order)" list. If missing, add it using the Add button.

## 3. WSL2 VPN Connection
**Problem**: VPN not running in WSL2

**Solution**: This might occur because `systemd` is not running in WSL2 by default. To fix:
1. Run `sudo -e /etc/wsl.conf`
2. Add `system=true` to `[boot]` section
3. Comment out the first line `LABEL=cloudimg-rootfs / ext4 defaults 0 1`
4. In `cmd.exe/PowerShell` run `wsl --shutdown` to restart WSL2
