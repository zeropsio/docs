# VPN Troubleshooting Guide

## 1. Interface Already Exists
**Problem**: When running `zcli vpn up`, you get an error like:
```
ERR /opt/homebrew/bin/wg-quick up /opt/homebrew/etc/wireguard/zerops.conf: [+] Interface for zerops is utun6 wg-quick: 'zerops' already exists as 'utun6'
```

**Solution**: Reset the VPN connection by running:
```bash
zcli vpn down
zcli vpn up
```

## 2. macOS Hostname Resolution
**Problem**: Even with VPN successfully connected, hostname resolution fails on macOS with errors like:
```
could not translate host name "hostname" to address: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

**Solution**: On macOS, append `.zerops` to the hostname, even when VPN shows as connected:
```bash
# Instead of
psql -h hostname -U user

# Use
psql -h hostname.zerops -U user
```

## 3. WSL2 VPN Connection
**Problem**: VPN not running in WSL2

**Solution**: This might occur because `systemd` is not running in WSL2 by default. To fix:
1. Run `sudo -e /etc/wsl.conf`
2. Add `system=true` to `[boot]` section
3. Comment out the first line `LABEL=cloudimg-rootfs / ext4 defaults 0 1`
4. In `cmd.exe/PowerShell` run `wsl --shutdown` to restart WSL2
