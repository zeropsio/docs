This guide provides detailed configuration instructions for making your Zerops services publicly accessible from the internet. For an overview of all access methods, see the [Access & Networking guide](/features/access).

## Public Access Methods

Choose the access method that best fits your needs:

- **[Zerops Subdomain Access](#zerops-subdomain-access)** - Quick setup with `.zerops.app` domains, ideal for development and testing
- **[Custom Domain Access](#custom-domain-access)** - Production-ready access through your own domains with full SSL support
- **[Direct Port Access](#direct-port-access)** - Direct port routing for non-HTTP protocols and specialized applications

## Zerops Subdomain Access

Zerops subdomains provide quick public access through `.zerops.app` addresses, ideal for development and testing environments.

### Configuration

1. Navigate to your service detail page in Zerops GUI
2. Select **Subdomain & domain & IP access** from the left menu (for runtime services)
3. Toggle the **Zerops subdomain access** switch

<figure style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '1rem 0' }}>
  <Image
    lightImage="/img/gui/public-access.webp"
    darkImage="/img/gui/public-access.webp"
    alt="Public Access"
    style={{ width: '90%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</figure>

Once enabled, Zerops assigns a unique subdomain for your application. If you've defined multiple [internal ports](/zerops-yaml/specification#ports-) with HTTP support in your `zerops.yaml`, each port receives its own unique `.zerops.app` subdomain.

### Technical Implementation

When using Zerops subdomains:
- Access your application using the `https://` protocol (Zerops automatically manages SSL certificates)
- Traffic flows through a central HTTP balancer that:
  - Terminates SSL connections
  - Forwards requests to your application via HTTP
  - Handles all security certificates

### Limitations

:::warning Production Considerations
- The central HTTPS balancer is shared across all Zerops projects, which creates a scalability bottleneck
- Maximum upload size is limited to 50MB
- Not recommended for production traffic due to scalability bottleneck
- Better suited for development and testing environments
:::

## Custom Domain Access

Custom domain access provides production-ready public access through your own domain names, offering better performance and full control over domain settings.

    alt="Public Access"
    style={{ width: '65%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</figure>

### IP Address Configuration

Before setting up domain access, you need to configure public IP addresses. Zerops offers the following options:

#### IPv4 Configuration

**Dedicated IPv4 Address ($3/30 days)**
- Dedicated to your project and shared across all project services
- One IPv4 address per project limit
- Protects against blacklisting risks associated with shared IPs
- Subscription automatically renews every 30 days *(cannot be purchased with promo credit)*
- Fee is non-refundable but address can be reused in another project until subscription ends
- **Recommended for production workloads**

**Shared IPv4 Address (Free)**
- Available at no cost
- Shared across all Zerops users and their projects
- Limitations:
  - For HTTP/HTTPS traffic only
  - Restricted number of open connections
  - Shorter connection timeouts
- **Not recommended for production use**

#### IPv6 Configuration

**IPv6 Address (Free)**
- Dedicated to your project and shared across all project services
- One IPv6 address per project limit
- Automatically activated with first domain setup
- Available for all projects at no additional cost

:::tip Dual Stack Recommendation
Since IPv6 support is not universal, using both IPv4 and IPv6 is recommended for maximum accessibility.
:::

### HTTP Routing Setup

To configure domain access:

1. Go to your service detail page in Zerops GUI and select **Subdomain & domain & IP access** (or access from project's **Project & Services Access Overview** section → **HTTP Balancer (L7) Configuration & Public Access Through Domains**)
   - For advanced L7 balancer settings (connection handling, buffers, performance optimization), click **Advanced balancer configuration**
2. Click **Setup first domain access**
3. Configure domain settings:
   - Enter domain names (e.g., `mydomain.com`, `app.mydomain.com`)
   - Add multiple domains if needed (useful for multi-language sites)
   - Choose SSL certificate management
4. Define routing rules:
   - **Source:** The public path (the part of URL after your domain)
   - **Destination:** Choose which application and internal port receives the traffic
   - Add multiple routing configurations as needed

:::tip Alternative Access
Domain configuration can also be accessed from individual service pages under **Subdomain & domain & IP access**.
:::

All settings can be modified later as your needs change.

### DNS Configuration

After setting up domain access in Zerops, configure your DNS records with your domain registrar:

:::tip DNS Configuration Guides
- **Cloudflare users:** Follow the [Cloudflare DNS Configuration Guide](/references/networking/cloudflare) for step-by-step Cloudflare-specific instructions
- **Other providers:** Use the [DNS and Proxy Configuration Guide](/references/networking/dns) for universal DNS setup instructions
:::

### HTTPS & SSL Configuration

When using Let's Encrypt certificates (recommended):

**Certificate Management:**
- Zerops handles all certificate installation and renewal automatically
- Certificates are provided free of charge
- No manual certificate management required

**Traffic Flow:**
1. Traffic arrives at your public IPv4/IPv6 addresses
2. Requests route through your project's dedicated HTTPS balancer
3. SSL termination occurs at the balancer level
4. Internal traffic uses HTTP protocol for optimal performance

**Balancer Architecture:**
- Deployed in two containers for high availability
- Scales vertically based on traffic demands
- Cannot be directly modified by users
- Included free of charge with custom domain setup

**Load Balancing:**
- **Round-robin load balancing** across multiple service instances
- **Health checks** to route traffic only to healthy instances
- **Connection pooling** for improved performance

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use dedicated IPv4 addresses instead of shared ones for high-traffic applications
- Consider the [L7 Balancer advanced configuration options](/references/networking/l7-balancer-config) for production optimization

## Direct Port Access

Direct port access enables public access to specific ports on your services, supporting any protocol and specialized use cases beyond HTTP.

:::important Service Compatibility
Currently, direct public port access is only available for runtime services and PostgreSQL databases.

    alt="Public Access Port"
    style={{ width: '90%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</figure>

### Port Configuration

1. Navigate to your service detail page in Zerops GUI:
   - For runtime services: Select **Subdomain & domain & IP access**
   - For PostgreSQL services: Select **Direct access through IP address**
   - Or access from project's **Project & Services Access Overview** section → **Direct IP Accesses to Services**
2. Configure port settings:
   - Either **Setup first access through IPv6** or activate **Unique IPv4 add-on** (if needed)
   - Choose any port from 10-65435 (ports 80 and 443 are reserved)
   - Select destination service and internal port
   - Each public port can be mapped to any internal service port
   - Multiple public ports can point to the same internal port if needed
   - Port configurations can be set independently for IPv4 and IPv6

:::tip Service-Level Access
For runtime services, you can also access port configuration from the service detail page under **Subdomain & domain & IP access**.
:::

### Firewall Configuration

Secure your public ports with optional firewall rules:

1. **Enable firewall** for specific ports
2. **Choose policy type:**
   - **Blacklist:** Block specific IPs/ranges (allow all others)
   - **Whitelist:** Allow only specific IPs/ranges (block all others)
3. **Configure IP rules:**
   - **Single IP format:** Affects only the specific IP address
   - **IP range format:** Affects all IPs in the specified CIDR range

   src="/img/gui/enable-firewall.webp"

   style={{ width: '90%', height: 'auto' }}
 />
</figure>

For information about Zerops' platform-wide firewall and port restrictions, see the [Firewall Reference Guide](/references/networking/firewall).

### Protocol Support

Direct port access supports:
- **TCP protocols:** HTTP, HTTPS, database connections, custom TCP services
- **UDP protocols:** DNS, gaming protocols, custom UDP services
- **Any port-based protocol** your application requires
