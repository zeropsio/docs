title: Integrating Your GitLab Repository
description:
---
Integrate Zerops to your GitLab repository and configure the automatic builds and deploys.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start the integration, create a new runtime service and ensure `zerops.yml` file in the root of your repository.
For more information, refer to our [zerops.yml](/references/zeropsyml) documentation.

---

## Integration Steps

1. **Access Service Settings**

   - Log into the Zerops GUI
   - Go to your service details
   - Navigate to "Build, deploy, run pipeline settings" in the left menu

2. **Connect to GitLab**

   - Click "Connect with a GitLab repository"
   - Grant Zerops access to your repositories when prompted

:::note
Zerops requires full access to configure webhooks and download your code. Your source code is not stored after the build process.
:::

3. **Select Repository and Trigger**

   - Choose the repository to integrate
   - Select a trigger method:
     - **New tag**: Builds trigger on new tags
       - Optionally add a regex to filter tags
     - **Push to branch**: Builds trigger on pushes to a specific branch

4. **Finalize Setup**
   - Confirm your settings to complete the integration

## Managing Your Integration

### Skipping a Build

To skip a build for a specific commit, include `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` (case insensitive) in your commit message.

:::note
The webhook will still show as delivered in GitLab, but no action will be taken.
:::

### Disconnecting Your Repository

To stop the integration:

1. Go to your service details
2. Select "Build, deploy, run pipeline settings"
3. Click "Stop automatic build trigger"

This action removes the GitLab webhook and deletes the integration configuration.
