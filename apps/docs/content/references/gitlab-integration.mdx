---

Discover how to seamlessly integrate your GitLab repository with Zerops for automated builds and deployments.

This guide walks you through the step-by-step process to link your repository, configure triggers, and manage your integrations efficiently.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration process, ensure your repository contains a valid `zerops.yml` configuration file located in the root directory. This file is essential for defining the build, deploy, and run processes.
For detailed information on how to create or modify this file, refer to the [Zerops YAML configuration](/references/zeropsyml) guide.

## Integration Steps

Follow these steps to connect your Gitlab repository with Zerops:

1. **Access Service Settings**

   - Log into the [**Zerops GUI**](https://app.zerops.io/)
   - Select the relevant service from your dashboard.
   - In the left-hand menu, navigate to **Build, Deploy, Run Pipeline Settings**.

2. **Connect to GitLab**

   - Click **Connect with a GitLab repository**
   - You'll be prompted to authorize Zerops to access your GitLab account.
   - Grant the necessary permissions for Zerops to manage webhooks and fetch your code.

:::note
Zerops requires full access to configure webhooks and download your code. Your source code is not stored after the build process.
:::

3. **Select Repository and Trigger**

   - Choose the repository to integrate
   - Select a trigger method:
     - **New tag**: Builds trigger on new tags
       - Optionally add a regex to filter tags
     - **Push to branch**: Builds trigger on pushes to a specific branch

4. **Finalize Setup**
   - Confirm your settings to complete the integration

## Managing Your GitLab Integration

To skip triggering a build for a specific commit, you can include `ci skip` or `skip ci` in your commit message (case insensitive). This tells Zerops to ignore that particular commit during the build process.

:::note
Although the webhook will still be delivered to GitLab, no action will be taken if `ci skip` is present in the commit message.

## Disconnecting Your Repository

To disconnect your GitLab repository from Zerops:

1. Navigate to the **Service Details** page for the relevant service
1. Select **Build, Deploy, Run Pipeline Settings** from the menu.
1. Click **Stop automatic build trigger**

**This action will remove the GitLab webhook and delete the associated integration configuration, effectively halting automated builds from this repository.**
