description: Learn how to integrate your GitHub repositories with Zerops
---

Discover how to seamlessly integrate your GitHub repository with Zerops for automated builds and deployments.

This guide walks you through the step-by-step process to link your repository, configure triggers, and manage your integrations efficiently.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration process, ensure your repository contains a valid `zerops.yml` configuration file located in the root directory. This file is essential for defining the build, deploy, and run processes.
For detailed information on how to create or modify this file, refer to the [Zerops YAML configuration](/references/zeropsyml) guide.

## Integration Steps

Follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository with Zerops:

1. **Access Service Settings**

   - Log into the [**Zerops GUI**](https://app.zerops.io/)
   - Select the relevant service from your dashboard.
   - In the left-hand menu, navigate to **Build, Deploy, Run Pipeline Settings**.

2. **Connect to GitHub**

   - Click **Connect with a GitHub repository**
   - You'll be prompted to authorize Zerops to access your GitHub account.
   - Grant the necessary permissions for Zerops to manage webhooks and fetch your code.

:::note
Zerops requires full access to your repository in order to configure webhooks and pull the latest code changes. However, Zerops does not store your source code unless explicitly specified by you.
:::

3. **Select Repository and Trigger**

   - Choose the GitHub repository you'd like to integrate with Zerops.
   - Configure the trigger that will initiate a build:
     - **New tag**: Builds are triggered whenever a new tag is created. This is the recommended option for production deployments.
       - You can optionally add a regular expression (regex) to filter specific tags.
     - **Push to branch**: Builds are triggered on every push to a specified branch, such as `main` or `develop`.

4. **Finalize Setup**

   - Review and confirm your settings to complete the integration process.
   - Your GitHub repository is now connected, and builds will be triggered based on the configured triggers.

## Managing Your GitHub Integration

To skip triggering a build for a specific commit, you can include `ci skip` or `skip ci` in your commit message (case insensitive). This tells Zerops to ignore that particular commit during the build process.

:::note
Although the webhook will still be delivered to GitHub, no action will be taken if `ci skip` is present in the commit message.

## Disconnecting Your Repository

To disconnect your GitHub repository from Zerops:

1. Navigate to the **Service Details** page for the relevant service
1. Select **Build, Deploy, Run Pipeline Settings** from the menu.
1. Click **Stop automatic build trigger**

**This action will remove the GitHub webhook and delete the associated integration configuration, effectively halting automated builds from this repository.**
