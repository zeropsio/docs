# Integrating your GitHub repository

Integrate Zerops to your GitHub repository and configure the automatic builds and deploys.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start the integration, ensure you have `zerops.yml` file in the root of your repository.
For more information, refer to our [zerops.yml](/references/zeropsyml) documentation.

## Integration Steps

1. **Access Service Settings**

   - Log into the [Zerops GUI](https://app.zerops.io/)
   - Select your service
   - Navigate to "Build, deploy, run pipeline settings" in the left menu

2. **Connect to GitHub**

   - Click "Connect with a GitHub repository"
   - Grant Zerops access to your repositories when prompted

:::note
Zerops requires full access to configure webhooks and download your code. We don't store your source code unless explicitly specified.
:::

3. **Select Repository and Trigger**

   - Choose the repository to integrate
   - Select a trigger method
     - New tag: Builds trigger on new tags **(Recommended)**
       - Optionally add a regex to filter tags
     - Push to branch: Builds trigger on pushes to specific branch

4. **Finalize Setup**

   - Confirm your settings to complete the integration

## Managing Your Integration

To skip a build for a specific commit, include `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` (case insensitive) in your commit message.

:::note
The webhook will still show as delivered in GitHub, but no action will be taken.

## Disconnecting Your Repository

### To stop the integration:

1. Go to your service details
1. Select "Build, deploy, run pipeline settings"
1. Click "Stop automatic build trigger"

**This action removes the GitHub webhook and deletes the integration configuration.**
