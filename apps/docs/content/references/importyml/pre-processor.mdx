The `yamlPreprocessor` option in your service import YAML configuration allows you to generate some random secret values, passwords, and public/private keys and store them for later to reuse in the service.


## How does it works?

The `yamlPreprocessor=on` is a required line in your import YAML to enable the preprocessor.

```yml
#yamlPreprocessor=on
project:
  name: project
services:
  - hostname: app
    type: nodejs@latest
    buildFromGit: https://github.com/example/app
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
    envSecrets:
      # yamlPreprocessor feat - generate a random 64 char and stores it
      SECRET_KEY: <@generateRandomString(<64>)>
    
  - hostname: db
    type: postgresql@16
    mode: HA
```

After you've added the `yamlPreprocessor=on` line, the preprocessor will be enabled and you can now utilize the functions.
