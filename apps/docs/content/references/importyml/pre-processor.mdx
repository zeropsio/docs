The Zerops YAML import scripts allow you to create and instantiate the entire Zerops projects or selected services with one click in Zerops GUI or even fully automate necessary steps via the zCLI import command. They are certainly simple and great ways to manage many real cases effectively.

But there could be moments when you either need to dynamically generate some extra data, like random values, passwords, and public/private keys and store them for later reuse in the script or somehow transform already existing values.
