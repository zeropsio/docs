Zerops includes a comprehensive firewall system implemented using [nftables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nftables) to ensure platform security.

The primary focus is on managing outbound communication to prevent potential platform misuse while maintaining the flexibility needed for legitimate applications.

## What is a Firewall?

A Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

At Zerops, we implemented a robust firewall system to protect our platform and your applications.

## Default Firewall Rules

### Allowed Outbound Ports

| Protocol | Port | Service |
|----------|------|---------|
| TCP/UDP | 80 | HTTP |
| TCP/UDP | 443 | HTTPS |
| TCP/UDP | 22 | SSH |
| TCP/UDP | 53 | DNS |
| TCP/UDP | 123 | NTP |

### Restricted Ports

To maintain platform security, certain ports are restricted:

- **TCP**: All ports in the range 1-1024 (except those explicitly allowed above)
- **UDP**: All ports in the range 1-65535 (except those explicitly allowed above)

> **Note**: Ports outside these ranges are generally unrestricted.

## Security Measures

These firewall rules are strategically implemented to:

- Prevent unauthorized use of the Zerops infrastructure for spam or network attacks
- Protect Zerops and its users from potential security threats
- Maintain compliance with security best practices

## Requesting Firewall Modifications

If your application requires access to additional ports:

1. Contact Zerops support at `support@zerops.io`.
2. Include in your request:
   - Detailed explanation of your use case.
   - Specific ports and protocols needed.
   - Mention your Project ID and Organization ID from your Zerops Dashboard.

## Common Use Cases

### Standard Web Applications (HTTP/HTTPS)

- Full access to HTTP/HTTPS communication (ports 80/443)
- Unrestricted DNS queries (port 53)
- Time synchronization via NTP (port 123)

> Enabled by default for all projects on Zerops.

### Email Services

- Additional configuration required for SMTP
- [Contact Support](/help/contacts) for email-related port access

### Custom Applications
- Special port requirements should be discussed with support
- Each request is evaluated based on security implications
