title: Connecting to Your Service via SSH
description: Learn how to establish SSH connections to your services using VPN

:::note
SSH access is available only for runtime services and web servers.
Database services, message brokers, and object storage are not accessible via SSH.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before establishing an SSH connection to your runtime service, you must first connect to the [Zerops VPN](/references/vpn).

## Setting Up Your Connection

### 1. Configure VPN Access

The [Zerops CLI (zCLI)](/references/cli) comes bundled with the [Zerops VPN](/references/vpn) client. To connect to your [Zerops project](/features/infrastructure#project):

1. [Install and configure zCLI](/references/cli)
2. [Initialize the Zerops VPN connection](/references/vpn#start-vpn)

### 2. Establish SSH Connection

Once your VPN session is active, you can connect to any [service](/features/infrastructure#services--containers) using its hostname:

```sh
ssh <service hostname>
```

Example:
```sh
ssh app
```

When connecting for the first time, you may receive this security prompt:

```sh title="bash"
The authenticity of host 'app (x.x.x.x)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:5wdgRcp/...
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Type `yes` to trust the host and prevent future prompts.

## Connecting to Specific Containers

To access a specific container instead of the service as a whole, use the container's hostname:

```sh
ssh <container hostname>
```

Example:
```sh
ssh node-id-1.runtime.app.zerops
```

:::note
When using [HA mode](/features/scaling-ha), connecting to the service hostname will route you to a random container within that service.
:::

## Container Naming Conventions

Each container in your project has a unique hostname following these patterns:

- Format 1: `node-id-<number>.runtime.app.zerops`
- Format 2: `node<number>.runtime.app.zerops`

When your application [scales horizontally](https://docs.zerops.io/features/scaling-ha#vertical-and-horizontal-auto-scaling):
- New containers receive incremental hostnames
- Decommissioned container hostnames are not recycled
- You might see non-sequential container numbers (e.g., `node-id-5` and `node-id-12`)
- Container hostnames may change as your service scales

:::warning
Never connect to containers using their local IP addresses, as these addresses are dynamic and may change.
:::

## Important Considerations

### Non-Persistent Changes

SSH connections should not be used for making persistent changes to your service:

- In [HA mode](/features/scaling-ha), changes via SSH affect only the current container
- Container replacements or scaling events will deploy the original application version
- For persistent changes across all containers, use:
  - [`run.prepareCommands`](https://docs.zerops.io/zerops-yml/specification#preparecommands-1)
  - [`run.initCommands`](https://docs.zerops.io/zerops-yml/specification#initcommands)
