title: Log Forwarding
description: Learn how to set up log forwarding in Zerops.
---

For more advanced [log](/references/logging) analysis and centralized logging, you can forward all your Zerops logs to external logging services. The Zerops logger service uses **syslog-ng** to enable this functionality.

## Ready-Made Configurations

Zerops provides pre-configured setups for popular logging services:

- **[Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/)**
- **[Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.com/)**
- **Self-hosted [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack) (Logstash)**

To set up one of these integrations, go to your project detail, select **Advanced Observability**, choose your preferred service, and follow the guided steps in the interface.

## Self-Hosted Logstash

To collect logs in a self-hosted ELK stack, a Logstash instance (deployed as the `logstash` service) is required. Logstash listens for incoming UDP syslog packets and indexes them to Elasticsearch.

The one-click GUI integration setup is all you need to get started. After setup completes, logs will appear in Kibana's "Logs > Explorer" section. You can find access information in the **Advanced Observability** section of your project in the GUI.

:::warning
Setting up log forwarding to ELK will override any previously configured log forwarding.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. The `elkstorage`, `kibana`, and `logstash` services are deployed and configured in the target project (if not already present)
2. If logging is required across different projects, the `logstash` service is made publicly accessible through port routing with firewall whitelisting for source project IPs
3. Log forwarding is configured on source projects to forward logs to the target Logstash instance

## Custom Log Forwarding Configuration

You can set up forwarding to any syslog-ng compatible software. To do this, navigate to your project detail's **Advanced Observability** section, and choose the "Setup forwarding to any syslog-ng compatible software" option.

When configuring your custom syslog-ng setup, note the following important details:

### Certificate Configuration
- Certificates are located in `/etc/ssl/certs`
- If your configuration references `/etc/syslog-ng/ca.d` or `/etc/syslog-ng/cert.d`, change these paths to `/etc/ssl/certs`
- For custom certificates, you can use: `ca-file("/etc/syslog-ng/user.crt")`
- You can combine custom certificates with standard certificates using: `ca-dir("/etc/ssl/certs")`
  (This will verify both your custom certificate and standard certificates like those from LetsEncrypt)

### Source Configuration
- Zerops uses `s_src` as the source configuration name
- This differs from Papertrail, which might instruct you to "replace 's_sys' with the name you found" - in Zerops, always use `s_src` instead
