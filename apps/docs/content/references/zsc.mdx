Zerops Setup Control(Zsc) is a cli tool / helper installed to all containers, runtime and build,
which allows some direct modifications, like triggering scaling from inside the container,
adding new technologies, making sure that commands (like migration) run only once (even when
staring some high available setup with 3 containers)

It allows you to interact with your zerops project and services in a secure and private way with the help of VPN or the remote web terminal.

## Usage

You can interact with zsc in your active services inside your zerops project with the help of SSH to your service after you're
connected to the project using zerops vpn.

### Start VPN

:::info
Make sure you have installed zCLI to your system before you can use zCLI commands.
:::

Start a VPN session with:

```sh
zcli vpn up
```

```sh title="bash"
Usage:
  zcli vpn up [projectId] [flags]

Flags:
      --auto-disconnect    If set, zCLI will automatically disconnect from the VPN if it is already connected.
  -h, --help               the vpn up command.
      --projectId string   If you have access to more than one project, you must specify the project ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
```

Or you can also connect to a specfic project by passing your project ID which you can get from your zerops
dashboard gui and add it into the `projectId` parameter:

```sh
zcli vpn up Evs8Je4NTvKeIkUqoUXp2w
```

You may need enclose your project name with quotes if it contains contains spaces.

:::info
When running `zcli vpn up` for the first time, you'll be prompted to install the Zerops VPN daemon. 
Enter `y` to confirm (you may need to provide your root/administrator password).
:::

Once connected, you’ll have secure access to the project’s private network.

You can reach all services locally using their hostnames. However, environment variables are not available
when connected via VPN.

You can only connect to one project at a time. If you’re already connected to another project, that connection
will close automatically when you start a new connection by running `zcli vpn up` and choosing another project.

The VPN daemon keeps the connection open until you manually stop it. If the connection drops, it will automatically
try to reconnect.

### Stop VPN

Use `zcli vpn down` command to stop the existing VPN session.

```sh title="bash"
Usage:
  zcli vpn down [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   the vpn down command.
```
