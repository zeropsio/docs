description: Learn how to access logs in Zerops.
---

Zerops automatically collects logs from all services in your project through a built-in logger service. These logs include runtime operations, database activities, build processes, and more.

## Project-Wide Logs

To view all project logs, navigate to your project detail and select the **Logs overview** section, where you'll find a consolidated view of all logging activity from all services with multiple filtering options.

Additionally, in the **Advanced Observability** section, you can set up [log forwarding](/references/log-forwarding) to external logging services for more advanced analysis and long-term storage.

## Service-Specific Logs

Zerops provides different log types depending on the service:

### Build Logs
Shows the output from your build process:
- **GUI**: Service detail → **Pipelines & CI/CD settings** section → Pipeline detail → Build log
- **CLI**: <a href="/references/zcli/commands#service-log"><code>zcli service log --showBuildLogs</code></a>

:::note
The build log button is available only when the [build pipeline](/features/pipeline#build-phase) was triggered for the selected deploy.
:::

### Prepare Runtime Logs
Documents the creation of a custom runtime image:
- **GUI**: Service detail → **Pipelines & CI/CD settings** section → Pipeline detail → Prepare runtime log
- **CLI**: *Not currently supported*

:::note
The prepare runtime log button is available only when the [prepare runtime phase](/features/pipeline#runtime-prepare-phase-optional) was triggered for the selected deploy.
:::

### Runtime/Database Logs
Contains the operational output from your service.

- **GUI**:
  - Runtime services: Service detail → **Runtime logs**
  - Database services: Service detail → **Database logs**
- **CLI**: <a href="/references/zcli/commands#service-log"><code>zcli service log</code></a>

:::note
Each container has its own log. For services with multiple containers, select the specific container in the header. You can filter logs by severity level or time period.

To view logs from all containers of a service combined, you can either use the Project logs view or click the **Go to full service log** button in the service detail page.

:::important
For severity levels to work properly in Zerops, your application must log to syslog.
