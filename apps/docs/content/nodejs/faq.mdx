  <FAQItem question="Why is my Node.js build timing out or hanging on interactive prompts?">
    If your build process seems to be hanging or timing out, check your logs for interactive prompts that are waiting for input, such as:
    ```
    ? The modules directory at "/build/source/node_modules" will be removed and reinstalled from scratch. Proceed? (Y/n) â€£ true
    ```

    Set the environment variable `CI: true` to resolve the problem. This allows the installation to proceed automatically without requiring manual confirmation.
