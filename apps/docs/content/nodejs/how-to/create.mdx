title: Create a Node.js service in Zerops
---

Zerops provides a Node.js runtime service with extensive build support. Node.js runtime is highly scalable and customisable to suit both development and production. 

## Create Node.js service using Zerops GUI

First, set up a project in Zerops GUI. Then go to the project dashboard page and choose **Add new service** in the left menu in the **Services** block. Then add a new Node.js service:

**// TODO screenshot (add a new service page)**

### Choose Node.js version
Following Node.js major versions are currently supported:
* v18
* v16
* v14

:::caution
The Node.js major version is fixed after the service is created. It can't be changed later.
:::

### Set a hostname
Enter a unique service identifier like "app","cache", "gui" etc. Duplicate services with the same name in the same project are forbidden.

**Limitations:**
* maximum 25 characters
* must contain only lowercase ASCII letters (a-z) or numbers (0-9) 

:::caution
The hostname is fixed after the service is created. It can't be changed later.
:::

## Configure internal ports
Specify one or more internal ports on which your application will listen. The TCP port **3000** is predefined. You can set your own port number, configure multiple ports or create a service without an internal port. 

Projects in Zerops represent a group of one or more services. Services can be of different types (runtime services, databases, message brokers, object storage, etc.). All services of the same project share a **dedicated private network**. To connect to a service within the same project, just use the service hostname and its internal port. 

For example, to connect to a Node.js service with hostname = "app" and port = 3000 from another service of the same project, simply use `app:3000`. Read more about [how to access a Node.js service].

To add a new internal port, click on the **Open a new internal port** button. 

**// TODO screenshot (add a new internal port form)**

In the form, enter following information:

1. Select **TCP** or **UDP** protocol.
2. Check **HTTP protocol support** if a web server runs on the port. Zerops uses this information for the configuration of [external routing]. This option is available only in combination with the **TCP** protocol.
3. Enter the **port number**. The port number must be set between 10 and 65435. Ports outside this interval are reserved for internal Zerops systems.

:::info
Internal Node.js service ports can be changed later.
:::

### Set environment variables

Environment variables help you to run your application in different environments. They allow you to isolate all specific environment aspects from your application code and keep your app encapsulated. You can create several projects in Zerops that represent different environments (development, stage, production) or even each developer can have a project with its own environment.

On Zerops you don't have to create a `.env` file manually. Zerops handles the environment variables for you.

Just enter one or more environment variables using the **Add new variable** button. If you already have a `.env` file, paste its content into the form that opens when you click on the **Paste .env format** button.

**How to read env variables from Node.js**

Zerops passes all environment variables from all project services when your Node.js is deployed and started.
To access the local environment variable i.e. the variable set to this Node.js service in your app, use:

```process.env.YOUR_VARIABLE_KEY_HERE```

**How to read env variables of other project services**

All services of the same project can reference environment variables from other services. To use an environment variable from one service in another service in the same project, you must prefix the environment variable key with the service hostname and underscore.

**Examples:**

To access the `connectionString` ENV variable of the `nodejs1` service, use `nodejs1_connectionString` as the ENV variable key. 
To access the `password` ENV variable of the `nodejs2` service, use `nodejs2_password` as the ENV variable key.

Read more about how to create and use [environment variables](/features/env-variables).

:::info
Setting the environment variables is optional. Env variables can be changed later.
:::

### Set auto scaling configuration
Zerops scales the Node.js services automatically both vertically and horizontally. Vertical scaling means increasing or decreasing the hardware resources (CPU, RAM and disk) of a Node.js container. Horizontal scaling adds or removes whole containers.

**Vertical auto scaling**

Vertical auto scaling has following default configuration:

| &nbsp;              | Minimum resource | Maximum resource |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **vCPU**            | 1                | 20               | 
| **RAM**             | 0.25 GB          | 32 GB            |
| **Disk**            | 1 GB             | 100 GB           |

Node.js service always starts with the minimal resources.

For most cases, the default parameters will work without issues. If you need to limit the cost of the Node.js service, lower the maximal resources. Zerops will never scale above the selected maximums.

When you are experiencing problems with insufficient Node.js performance or capacity, increase the minimal resources. Zerops will never scale below the selected minimums.

:::info
You can change the vertical auto scaling parameters later.
:::

**// TODO screenshot (add a new Node.js service page - Automatic scaling section)**

**Horizontal auto scaling**

When a container needs more CPU or RAM but already consumes maximal resources defined for the vertical auto scaling, Zerops will add a new container to your Node.js service. When your Node.js service doesn't need so much power and all containers are vertically scaled down in such a way their CPU allocation is near the minimal resources, Zerops will gradually remove whole containers.

Horizontal auto scaling has following default configuration:
<table>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td><b>minimum containers</b></td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>maximum containers</b></td>
		<td>6</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Node.js service always starts with the minimum number of containers.

You can increase the minimum or decrease the maximum number of containers. The horizontal scaling parameters can be changed later.

:::caution
Check if your application is ready for [highly available mode]. If not, set the maximum containers to **1**. Zerops will never add more containers to your Node.js service.
:::

:::caution
You can keep the minimum at 1 container, but you should do so with caution and only for non-critical or dev services. Production grade service should start with at least 2 containers.

## Create Node.js service using zCLI
zCLI is the Zerops command-line tool. To create a new Node.js service via the command-line, follow these steps:
1. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli)
2. [Create a project description file](/nodejs/how-to/create#create-a-project-description-file) 
3. [Create a project with a Node.js and PostgreSQL service]

### Create a project description file
Zerops uses a yaml format to describe the project infrastructure.

**Basic example:**

Create a directory `my-project`. Create an `description.yml` file inside the `my-project` directory with following content:

```yaml
# basic project data
project:
  # project name
  name: my-project
# array of project services
services:
  -
    # service name
    hostname: app
    # service type and version number in nodejs@18 format
    type: nodejs@18
    # internal ports configuration
    ports:
      - 
         # port number
         port: 3000
         # set true if a webserver is running on the port
         httpSupport: true
    # defines the minimum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling
    minContainers: 1
    # defines the maximum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling. Max value = 6.
    maxContainers: 6
    # optional: create env variables 
    envVariables:
      S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "P8cX1vVVb"
      S3_ACCESS_SECRET: "ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

The yaml file describes your future project infrastructure. The project will contain one Node.js version 18 service with default [auto scaling] configuration. Hostname will be set to "app" and the application will listen on the TCP port 3000 that supports the HTTP communication. Following env variables will be configured:

```env
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="P8cX1vVVb"
S3_ACCESS_SECRET="ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

**Full example:**

Create a directory my-project. Create an description.yml file inside the my-project directory with following content:

```yaml
# basic project data
project:
  # project name
  name: my-project
  # optional: project description 
  description: A project with a Node.js and PostgreSQL database
  # optional: project tags
  tags:
  - DEMO
  - ZEROPS
# array of project services
services:
  -
    # service name
    hostname: app
    # service type and version number in nodejs@18 format
    type: nodejs@18
    # internal ports configuration
    ports:
      - 
         # port number
         port: 3000
         # set true if a webserver is running on the port
         httpSupport: true
      - 
         # port number
         port: 3001
         # set true if a webserver is running on the port
         httpSupport: false
      - 
         # port number
         port: 4000
         # set the "UDP" or "TCP" protocol, default "TCP"
         protocol: UDP
         # set true if a webserver is running on the port
         httpSupport: false
    # optional: vertical auto scaling customization 
    verticalAutoscaling: 
      minVCpu: 5
      maxVCpu: 10
      minRam: 2
      maxRam: 16
      minDisk: 2.5
      maxDisk: 50
    # defines the minimum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling. Max value = 6.
    minContainers: 2
    # defines the maximum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling. Max value = 6.
    maxContainers: 4
    # optional: create env variables 
    envVariables:
      S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "P8cX1vVVb"
      S3_ACCESS_SECRET: "ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
  -
    # second service hostname
    hostname: db
    # service type and version number in postgresql@12 format
    type: postgresql@12
    # mode of operation "HA"/"non_HA"
    mode: NON_HA
```

The yaml file describes your future project infrastructure. The project will contain a Node.js service and a [PostgreSQL↗] service. 

Node.js service with "app" hostname is configured to listen on tcp ports 3000, 3001 and on udp port 4000. Node.js service will run on version 18 with a custom vertical and horizontal scaling. Following env variables will be configured:

```env
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="P8cX1vVVb"
S3_ACCESS_SECRET="ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

The hostname of the PostgreSQL service will be set to "db". The [single container] mode will be chosen and the default [auto scaling configuration] will be set.

**Description of description.yml parameters**

The `project:` section is required. Only one project can be defined.

| Parameter              | Description                                                                   | Limitations             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------             |
| **name**               | The name of the new project. Duplicates are allowed.                          |                         |
| **description**        | **Optional.** Description of the new project.                                 | Maximum 255 characters. |
| **tags**               | **Optional.** One or more string tags. Tags do not have a functional meaning, they only provide better orientation in projects.          |


At least one service in `services:` section is required. You can create a project with multiple services. The example above contains Node.js and PostgreSQL services but you can create a `description.yml` with your own combination of [services].

### Create a project based on the description.yml

When you have your `description.yml` ready, use the `zcli project import` command to create a new project and the service infrastructure. 

```yml
Usage:
  zcli project import ./my-project/description.yml [flags]

Flags:
  --clientId <string>   If you have access to more than one client, you must specify the client ID for which the project is to be created.
  -h, --help   Displays help for the project import command.
```

Zerops will create a project and one or more services based on the `description.yml` content.

Maximum size of the `description.yml` file is 100 kB.

You don't specify the project name in the `zcli project import` command, because the project name is defined in the `description.yml`.

If you have access to more than one client, you must specify the client ID for which the project is to be created. The `clientID` is located in the Zerops GUI under the client name on the project dashboard page.

**// TODO screenshot (where the clientID is located in Zerops GUI)**

### Add Node.js service to an existing project

**Example:**

Create a directory `my-project` if it doesn't exist. Create an `import.yml` file inside the `my-project` directory with following content:

```yaml
# basic project data
project:
  # project name
  name: my-project
# array of project services
services:
  -
    # service name
    hostname: app
    # service type and version number in nodejs@18 format
    type: nodejs@18
    # internal ports configuration
    ports:
      - 
         # port number
         port: 3000
         # set true if a webserver is running on the port
         httpSupport: true
    # defines the minimum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling
    minContainers: 1
    # defines the maximum number of containers for horizontal autoscaling. Max value = 6.
    maxContainers: 6
    # optional: create env variables 
    envVariables:
      S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "P8cX1vVVb"
      S3_ACCESS_SECRET: "ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

The yaml file describes the list of one or more services that you want to add to your existing project. In the example above, one Node.js service version 18 listening on the port 3000 with default [auto scaling] configuration will be added to your project. Hostname of the new service will be set to `app`. Following env variables will be configured:

```env
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="P8cX1vVVb"
S3_ACCESS_SECRET="ogFthuiLYki8XoL73opSCQ"
```

The content of the `services:` section of `import.yml` is identical to the project description file. The `import.yml` never contains the `project:` section because the project already exists.

When you have your `import.yml` ready, use the `zcli project import` command to add one or more services to your existing Zerops project.

```sh
Usage:
  zcli service import [projectNameOrId] ./my-project/import.yml [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   Displays help for the service import command.
```

You must enclose the projectNameOrId in quotes if it contains a space. The project name is visible in Zerops GUI. If you have more projects with a duplicate name, use the project ID instead. You'll find the project ID in the URL of the project dashboard page in Zerops GUI. <br/>E.g. <code>https://app&#46;zerops.io/project/<b>Evs8Je4NTvKeIkUqoUXp2w</b>/service-stacks</code>.

Maximum size of the import.yml file is 100 kB.
