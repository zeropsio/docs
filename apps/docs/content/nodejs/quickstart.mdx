This quick start allows you to get hands-on experience of Zerops, whether you only want to see it in action or want to start small and scale up the project size later. The purpose of this guide is to get an existing Node.js application up and running easily.

If you are already familiar with Zerops and you are interested in more detailed guides for your own application, feel free to head straight to the [How to](/nodejs/how-to/create) section.

## Guides

We have created a repository, a *recipe*, containing the most simple Node.js web application, so you don't need to write any code yet. Choose from the options below which suits you best:
<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
      {
        type: 'link',
        href: 'quickstart/speedy-trial',
        label: 'No-Fuss one click guide (well, almost)',
        customProps: {
          icon: Icons['cursor-arrow-rays'],
          description: 'Get the application running in no time. Best if you only want to see how Zerops works.',
        }
      },
      {
        type: 'link',
        href: 'quickstart/easy-learn',
        label: 'Simple tutorial in few easy steps',
        customProps: {
          icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
          description: 'Learn the basics with one-service app.',
        }
      }
]} />
