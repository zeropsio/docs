Zerops provides a fully managed [NATS](https://nats.io/) messaging system with automated scaling and zero infrastructure overhead, letting developers focus entirely on development.

## Supported Versions

Currently supported NATS version:
<UnorderedList data={data.nats.readable}/>

Import configuration version:
<UnorderedCodeList data={data.nats.import}/>

## Service Configuration

Our NATS implementation features optimized default settings designed for common use cases.

**Key configuration aspects** include:
- Standard protocol port `4222` for client connections
- HTTP monitoring interface `8222` for management
- Secure authentication with automatically generated credentials
- Optimized settings for performance and reliability

### JetStream Configuration

The service includes [JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) functionality **enabled by default**, providing persistent storage capabilities for your messaging workloads:
- **Memory store**: Up to 40GB for high-performance message caching
- **File store**: Up to 250GB for persistent storage
- **Regular sync intervals**: Ensures data durability and consistency
:::note
In HA deployments, data persistence is further enhanced with 1-minute sync intervals across all nodes, ensuring robust data durability and high availability.
:::

This configuration provides a robust foundation for message persistence while balancing performance and reliability.

#### Disabling JetStream

If you don't need message persistence, you can disable JetStream by setting the `JET_STREAM_ENABLED` environment variable to `0` in your service configuration. This can be done:

- During service creation through the [import configuration](/references/import)
- In the Zerops GUI under service environment variables
- Via the [Zerops API](/references/api) when creating a new service

:::tip
Disabling JetStream may reduce resource usage when persistence isn't required for your application.
:::

### Deployment Modes

:::warning
Deployment mode is selected during service creation and cannot be changed later.
:::

#### Non-HA Mode
- Suitable for development and testing
- Data persistence not guaranteed during node failures
- Lower resource requirements

#### HA Mode
- Creates a multi-node NATS cluster
- Configures routes between cluster nodes automatically
- Implements [NATS clustering](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/clustering) for high availability
- Provides improved reliability compared to non-HA deployments

### Authentication Management

Authentication credentials are automatically generated and managed by the platform. The system creates a default user (`zerops`) with a secure 16-character password. You can access these credentials through:
- The service access details in the Zerops GUI
- Environment variables in your service configuration:
  - `user` - Username for authentication (default: "zerops")
  - `password` - Generated secure password
  - `connectionString` - Complete connection string in the format `nats://${dbUser}:${dbPassword}@${hostname}:${port}`

## Health Monitoring

Zerops continuously monitors your NATS service health using built-in health checks:

- **HTTP Health Check**: The system checks the `/healthz` endpoint at port 8222
- **Self-Healing**: The platform automatically recovers unhealthy nodes when issues are detected

### Health Status

You can check the health status of your NATS service:

1. Through the Zerops GUI dashboard
2. By accessing the management interface at port `8222`

## Backup and Recovery

Zerops provides built-in backup functionality for your NATS JetStream data, ensuring your message streams and configurations can be safely preserved and restored when needed.

### Backup Process

Backups are created in `.tar.gz` format using the `nats` backup command. They are saved to local disk, compressed, streamed to backup storage, and then deleted locally.

For general information about backup frequency and storage limits, see our [Backup documentation](/features/backup).
