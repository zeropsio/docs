This guide covers how to manage your PostgreSQL databases in Zerops, including default setup, database management tools, plugins, and best practices.

## Default Database and User

Zerops creates a default database and user automatically when a new PostgreSQL service is [created](/postgresql/how-to/create).

### Database

- **Name**: Identical to the service hostname
- **Encoding**: `utf8mb4`

### DB User

- **Username**: Identical to the service hostname
- **Password**: Generated randomly

:::info
For connection methods and environment variables, see the [Connect to PostgreSQL in Zerops](/postgresql/how-to/connect) page.
:::

:::caution Important notes
- When changing passwords, update both the database user password and the environment variable separately - they don't automatically synchronize.
- While both `postgresql://` and `postgres://` URI formats are valid, Zerops uses the `postgresql://` format. If your software requires `postgres://`, create a custom environment variable with this format.
- Do not use SSL/TLS protocols for internal connections. Security is assured by the project's private network.

## Database Management Tools

You can use any PostgreSQL management tool of your choice to administer your databases in Zerops. For convenience, Zerops provides ready-to-use recipes for two popular web-based database management tools:

* [AdminerEvo](https://github.com/adminerevo/adminerevo) - developed by the AdminerEvo community and is a continuation of the [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org) project by Jakub Vr√°na
* [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net) - a popular free database administration tool that works with both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases

### Installing Management Tools

You can install these tools with a simple one-click import in Zerops:

1. In Zerops GUI, open your project and select **Import services** from the left menu
2. Copy and paste one of the following YAML configurations:

<TabbedCodeBlocks
  tabs={[
    {
      label: 'AdminerEvo',
      language: 'yaml',
      code: `services:
  - hostname: adminerevo
    type: php-apache@8.3
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
    buildFromGit: https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-adminerevo`
    },
    {
      label: 'phpMyAdmin',
      language: 'yaml',
      code: `services:
  - hostname: phpmyadmin
    type: php-apache@8.1+2.4
    minContainers: 1
    maxContainers: 1
    documentRoot: public
    buildFromGit: https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-phpmyadmin@main`
    }
  ]}
  defaultTab="AdminerEvo"
/>

### Accessing Management Tools

After installation, you can access these tools via VPN:

1. [Start the Zerops VPN](/references/vpn)
2. Type `http://adminerevo` or `http://phpmyadmin` in your browser

:::tip
Try `http://adminerevo.zerops` or `http://phpmyadmin.zerops` if you encounter any connection issues.
:::

:::caution
Do not use https when connecting to management tools via VPN.

## Database Tools on Your Workstation

You can use various database management tools from your local workstation to connect to your PostgreSQL database in Zerops:

1. **Establish a secure tunnel** using the [Zerops VPN](/references/vpn) to create an encrypted connection to your Zerops project
2. **Obtain the [connection details](/postgresql/how-to/connect#connection-details)** from Zerops GUI
    - Environment variables are not available through VPN connections
3. Connect with your **preferred database tool**
    - Do not use SSL/TLS (security is provided by the VPN)
    - **Desktop Database Tools** - popular GUI tools like pgAdmin, DBeaver, DataGrip, or any other PostgreSQL-compatible client will work with Zerops
    - **Command Line with psql** - connect using the standard PostgreSQL command-line client with the credential obtained above:
        ```sh
        psql -h [hostname] -U [user] -d [database_name]
        ```

:::tip
    Try `{hostname}.zerops` instead of just `{hostname}` if you encounter any connection issues.

## How to install and manage PostgreSQL plugins

You can list all available PostgreSQL plugins by running the following query *(superuser privileges not required)*:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions ORDER BY name;
```

To install plugins, you must **connect as a superuser** (`postgres`) and run the appropriate CREATE EXTENSION command. For example:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

:::warning
Currently, it is not possible to add new plugins that are not already listed in `pg_available_extensions`.
:::

When working with text search functionality, you'll need to reference the correct `stop`, `dict`, and `affix` files when creating dictionaries in your database. These files are essential for proper text search configuration.

Zerops PostgreSQL includes the following dictionary files:

<Dropdown>
<DropdownItem title="Available dictionary files">
**Stop word files** - used to remove common words that don't add significant meaning:
```
czech.stop
danish.stop
dutch.stop
english.stop
finnish.stop
french.stop
german.stop
hungarian.stop
italian.stop
nepali.stop
norwegian.stop
polish.stop
portuguese.stop
russian.stop
slovak.stop
spanish.stop
swedish.stop
turkish.stop
```
**Dictionary and affix files** - used for stemming and word normalization:
```
cs_CZ.affix
cs_CZ.dict
en_US.affix
en_US.dict
pl_PL.affix
pl_PL.dict
sk_SK.affix
sk_SK.dict
```
**Special rules file:**
```
unaccent.rules
```
</DropdownItem>
</Dropdown>
For more information on text search dictionaries, refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/textsearch-dictionaries.html).
