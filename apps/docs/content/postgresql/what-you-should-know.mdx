# Managing PostgreSQL with Zerops

Zerops offers a developer-friendly platform for deploying and managing PostgreSQL databases. It provides both high-availability (HA) clusters and single-container modes to suit various needs. 

## What Zerops Manages

- **Provisioning & Deployment**: Zerops automates the setup of PostgreSQL services, allowing you to choose between HA clusters and single-container instances based on your requirements. 

- **Scaling**: Automatic vertical scaling adjusts CPU, RAM, and disk resources within defined limits, ensuring optimal performance. 

- **High Availability**: Zerops maintains a cluster with data redundancy across multiple containers in HA mode, providing automatic failover and self-healing capabilities. 

- **Networking & Security**: Each project includes dedicated infrastructure with private networking, load balancers, and firewalls, ensuring secure communication between services. 

## What You Manage

- **Application Integration**: Connect your application to the PostgreSQL service using the provided connection details.

- **Backup Strategies**: While Zerops offers automated backups, implementing additional backup plans can enhance data safety.

- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Set up custom monitoring and alerting systems to track your database's performance and resource utilization.

- **Scaling Policies**: Define scaling parameters to match your application's requirements, ensuring efficient resource usage.

## Key Considerations

- **Resource Allocation**: Ensure your PostgreSQL service has appropriate resources to prevent performance issues.

- **Service Mode Selection**: Based on your application's criticality and tolerance for downtime, choose between HA and single-container modes. 

- **Cost Management**: Monitor resource usage to optimize costs, taking advantage of Zerops' flexible scaling options.
