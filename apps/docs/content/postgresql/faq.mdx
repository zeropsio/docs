  <FAQItem question="Why is my connection to PostgreSQL from third-party software failing?">
    *One possible cause:* <br />
    The connection string in Zerops always starts with `postgresql://`. While the official PostgreSQL documentation
    states that both `postgresql://` and `postgres://` URIs are valid, some software requires the shorter `postgres://`
    version.
    
    To resolve this, create your own environment variable with the correct URI. For example, if your PostgreSQL service is named `db`, use the following format:
    
    ```
    postgres://${db_user}:${db_password}@${db_hostname}:${db_port}
    ```
