[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) on Zerops provides a fully managed vector database solution designed for AI applications. Focus on building vector search features while we handle infrastructure maintenance, high availability, and data protection.

## Supported Versions

Currently supported Qdrant versions:
<UnorderedList data={data.qdrant.readable}/>

Import configuration version:
<UnorderedCodeList data={data.qdrant.import}/>

## Deployment Modes

#### Non-HA Mode
- Single node setup ideal for development and non-production projects
- Simple deployment and management

#### HA Cluster
- Automatically configured with 3 nodes
- Recommended for production environments
- Built-in data replication across nodes
- By default (`automaticClusterReplication=true`), automatically creates replicas of all shards across all three nodes
  - Can be disabled by setting `automaticClusterReplication` to `false`
- Automatic cluster recovery and node replacement in case of failures

## Data Backup

Qdrant backups are created using native snapshotting:

- **Format**: `.snapshot` (compressed)
- **Tooling**: Native snapshotting
- **Source**: Taken from the primary node (leader in HA clusters)

For backup configuration, scheduling, retention policies, and management options, see the [Zerops Backups](/features/backup) documentation.

### Restoring Backups

To restore a Qdrant backup:

1. **Download** the backup file (`.snapshot`) from the Zerops UI
2. **Prepare** your target environment (clean existing collections or use a new instance)
3. **Restore** using the Qdrant API. Use the snapshot restore endpoint to import the snapshot file. Follow the [official Qdrant documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/database-tutorials/create-snapshot/#restore-from-snapshot) for detailed snapshot restore procedures.

For assistance with the restoration process, contact Zerops support.

## Network Architecture & Access

Qdrant can be accessed only from services within the same project, public access is not available.

### API Keys
API key authentication is required for both HTTP and gRPC API calls. Include the key in your request headers. The keys can be found in generated environment variables of the service:

- **API Key:** Full access API key for administrative operations (creating collections, indexing)
- **Read-only API Key:** Restricted API key for search operations

#### HTTP API
- **Port:** `6333`
- **Connection String:** `http://${hostname}:${port}`

#### gRPC API
- **Port:** `6334`
- **gRPC Connection String:** `tcp://${hostname}:${grpcPort}`
