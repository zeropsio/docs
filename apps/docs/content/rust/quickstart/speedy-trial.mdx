As said, there is no need for coding yet, we have created a [Github repository](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-rust-hello-world), a ***recipe***, containing the most simple Rust web application. The repo will be used as a source from which the app will be built.

1. Log in/sign up to [Zerops GUI](https://app.zerops.io)
2. In the **Projects** box click on **Import a project** and paste in the following yml config ([source](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-rust-hello-world/blob/main/import-as-project.yml)):

```yml
project:
  name: my-first-project
services:
- hostname: helloworld
  type: rust@1
  minContainers: 1
  maxContainers: 3
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    httpSupport: true
  buildFromGit: https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-rust-hello-world@main
  enableSubdomainAccess: true
```
3. Click on **Import project** and wait until all pipelines have finished.

**That's it, your application is now up and running! :star: Let's check it works:**

1. A *subdomain* should have been enabled and visible in the project's **IP addressed & Public Routing Overview** box. Its format should look similar to this `https://helloworld-24-8080.prg1.zerops.app`.
2. Click or the <code>subdomain</code> URL to open it in a browser and you should see

```
Hello, World!
```
