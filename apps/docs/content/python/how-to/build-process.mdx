## Description of the build process

Zerops starts a temporary build container and performs following actions:

1. Installs the build environment:
   - Sets up base system and Go runtime
   - Restores cached files if available (based on `build.cache` configuration)
   - Validates cache against current `build.os`, `build.base`, and `build.prepareCommands`
2. Downloads your application source code from [GitHub ↗](https://www.github.com), [GitLab ↗](https://www.gitlab.com) or via [Zerops CLI](/references/cli)
3. Optionally [customizes the build environment](#customize-python-build-environment)
4. Uploads the application artefact to the internal Zerops storage
5. Preserves specified files for future builds (based on `build.cache` configuration)
6. Optionally [customizes the runtime environment](/python/how-to/customize-runtime)
7. [Deploys your application](/python/how-to/deploy-process)

The build container is automatically deleted after the build has finished or failed.

## Cancel running build

When you know that the running build is not correct and you want to cancel it, you can do it in Zerops GUI. Go to the service detail, select **Service dashboard & runtime containers** from the left menu and click on the **Open pipeline detail** button. Then click on the **Cancel build** button.

The build cancellation is available before the build pipeline is finished. When the build is finished, the deployment cannot be cancelled.

## Customize Python build environment

The default Python build environment contains:

- <span>{data.alpine.default}</span>
- selected version of Python defined in `zerops.yml` [build.base](/python/how-to/build-pipeline#base) parameter
- [zCLI](/references/cli), Zerops command line tool
- `pip` and `git`

If you prefer the Ubuntu OS instead of Alpine, set the [build.os](/python/how-to/build-pipeline#os) attribute to `ubuntu`. To install additional packages or tools add one or more [build.prepareCommands](/python/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands) commands to your `zerops.yml`.

:::info
The application code is available in the `/var/www` folder in your build container before the prepare commands are triggered. This allows you to use any file from your application code in your prepare commands (e.g. a configuration file).

## Python build hardware resources

Build of your Python application is run in a separate build container with following resource configuration:

| HW resource   | Minimum | Maximum |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| **CPU cores** | 6       | 20      |
| **RAM**       | 8 GB    | 8 GB    |
| **Disk**      | 1 GB    | 100 GB  |

The build container is always started with the minimum hardware resources and scales vertically up to the maximum resources.

:::info
Hardware resources of the build containers are not charged. The build costs are covered by the standard Zerops [project fee](https://zerops.io/#pricing).
:::

## Build time limit

The time limit for the whole build pipeline is **1 hour**. After 1 hour, Zerops will terminate the build pipeline and delete the build container.

## Troubleshooting build-related problems

### Failure of a build prepare command

If any [prepare command](/python/how-to/build-pipeline#preparecommands) fails, it returns an exit code other than 0 and the build is canceled. Read the [build log](/python/how-to/logs#build-log) to troubleshoot the error. If the command ends successfully, it returns the exit code 0 and Zerops triggers the following command. When all `prepareCommands` commands are finished, your custom build environment is ready for the build phase.

### Invalidate the build cache
If you encounter unexpected build behavior or dependency issues, the problem might be related to [cached build data](/features/build-cache). While Zerops maintains the build cache to speed up deployments, sometimes you may need to start fresh.
To invalidate the build cache:

1. Go to your service detail in Zerops GUI
2. Choose **Pipelines & CI/CD Settings** from the left menu
3. Click on the **Invalidate build cache** button

This will force Zerops to run the next build clean, including all prepare commands, which can help resolve cache-related issues. After invalidation, your next build will also create a fresh cache.
