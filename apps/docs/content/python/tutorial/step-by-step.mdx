As said, there is no need for coding yet, we have created a [Github repository ↗](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-python-hello-world), a **_recipe_**, containing the most simple Python web application. The repo will be used as a source from which the app will be built.

:::tip
Follow the steps below and when everything is working as expected, fork the repo, try making various changes or be bold and connect your own.
