[Alpine Linux ↗](https://alpinelinux.org/) is a lightweight, security-oriented Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox, known for its small footprint and efficiency.

Alpine services in Zerops provide a minimal base environment for running applications built with technologies that aren't officially supported by Zerops, or for custom setups requiring full control over the runtime environment while keeping resource usage low.
