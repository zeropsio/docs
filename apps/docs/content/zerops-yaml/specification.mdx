The `zerops.yaml` file is crucial for defining how Zerops should [build and deploy](/features/pipeline) your application.
Add the `zerops.yaml` file to the **root of your repository** and customize it to suit your application's needs.

## Basic Structure

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
zerops:
  - setup: <service_name>
    build: ...
    run: ...
```

- The top-level element is always `zerops`.
- `setup` contains the **hostname** of your service (must exist in Zerops).
- Multiple services can be defined in a single `zerops.yaml` (useful for monorepos):

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build: ...
    run: ...

  - setup: api
    build: ...
    run: ...
```

Each service configuration requires `build` and `run` sections. An optional `deploy` section can be added for readiness checks.

## Service Inheritance

### extends <Badge type="optional" />

The `extends` key allows you to inherit configuration from another service defined in the same `zerops.yaml` file. This is useful for creating environment-specific configurations while maintaining a common base.

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: base
    build:
      buildCommands:
        - echo "hello"
      deployFiles: ./
    run:
      start: server run

  - setup: prod
    extends: base
    run:
      crontab:
        - command: xyz
          allContainers: false
          timing: "* * * * *"

  - setup: dev
    extends: base
    run:
      crontab:
        - command: different command
          allContainers: false
          timing: "* * * * *"
```

When using `extends`:
- The `extends` value must refer to another service's `setup` value in the same file
- The child service inherits all configuration from the base service
- Configuration is merged at the section level (`build`, `run`, `deploy`)
- You can override specific sections by redefining them

:::tip
Create a base service with common configuration and extend it for environment-specific services to keep your `zerops.yaml` file DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
:::

## Build Configuration

### base <Badge type="required" />

Sets the base technology for the build environment. [See available options](/zerops-yaml/base-list).

```yaml
build:
  base: nodejs@latest
```

You can specify multiple technologies:

```yaml
build:
  base:
    - nodejs@latest
  prepareCommands:
    - zsc add python@3.9
```

### os <Badge type="optional" />

Sets the operating system for the build environment. Options:

- `alpine` (default)
- `ubuntu`

Current versions:

- {data.alpine.default}
- {data.ubuntu.default}

```yaml
build:
  os: ubuntu
```

### prepareCommands <Badge type="optional" />

Customizes the build environment by installing additional dependencies or tools.

```yaml
build:
  prepareCommands:
    - apt-get update
    - apt-get install -y some-package
```

### buildCommands <Badge type="required" />

Defines the commands to build your application.

```yaml
build:
  buildCommands:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
```

#### Running commands in a single shell instance:

```yaml
buildCommands:
  - |
    npm install
    npm run build
```

### deployFiles <Badge type="required" />

Specifies which files or folders to deploy after a successful build.

```yaml
build:
  deployFiles:
    - dist
    - package.json
    - node_modules
```

The files/folders will be placed into `/var/www` folder in runtime, e.g. `./src/assets/fonts` would result in `/var/www/src/assets/fonts`.

#### Using wildcards:

Zerops supports the `~` character as a wildcard for one or more folders in the path.

Deploys all `file.txt` files that are located in any path that begins with `/path/` and ends with `/to/`.

```yaml
deployFiles: ./path/~/to/file.txt
```

By default, `./src/assets/fonts` deploys to `/var/www/src/assets/fonts`, keeping the full path. Adding `~`, like `./src/assets/~fonts`, shortens it to `/var/www/fonts`

#### .deployignore

Add a `.deployignore` file to the root of your project to specify which files and folders Zerops should ignore during deploy. The syntax follows the same pattern format as <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format">`.gitignore`</a>.

To ignore a specific file or directory path, start the pattern with a forward slash (`/`). Without the leading slash, the pattern will match files with that name in any directory.

:::tip
For consistency, it's recommended to configure both your `.gitignore` and `.deployignore` files with the same patterns.
:::

Examples:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      deployFiles: ./
```

```text title=".deployignore"
/src/file.txt
```
The example above ignores `file.txt` only in the root src directory.
```text title=".deployignore"
src/file.txt
```
This example above ignores `file.txt` in ANY directory named `src`, such as:
- `/src/file.txt`
- `/folder2/folder3/src/file.txt`
- `/src/src/file.txt`

:::note
`.deployignore` file also works with <a href="/references/cli/commands#deploy">`zcli service deploy`</a> command.
:::

### cache <Badge type="optional" />

Defines which files or folders to cache for subsequent builds.

```yaml
build:
  cache: node_modules
```

For more information, see our detailed [guide on build cache](/features/build-cache), complete with extensive examples.

### envVariables <Badge type="optional" />

Sets environment variables for the build environment.

```yaml
build:
  envVariables:
    DB_NAME: db
    DB_HOST: db
    DB_USER: db
    DB_PASS: ${db_password}
```

:::info
The `yamlPreprocessor` option in your project & service import YAML allows you to generate random secret values, passwords, and public/private key pairs. For more information, see the [yamlPreprocessor](/references/import-yaml/pre-processor) page.
:::

## Runtime Configuration

### base <Badge type="optional" />

Sets the base technology for the runtime environment. If not specified, the current version is maintained.

```yaml
run:
  base: nodejs@latest
```

### os <Badge type="optional" />

Sets the operating system for the runtime environment. Options and versions are the same as for the build environment.

### ports <Badge type="optional" />

Specifies the internal ports on which your application will listen.

```yaml
run:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      protocol: TCP # Optional
      httpSupport: true # Optional
    - port: 8081
      ...
```

Available parameters:

#### port <Badge type="required" />
Defines the port number on which your application listens. Must be between *10* and *65435*, as ports outside this range are reserved for internal Zerops systems.

#### protocol <Badge type="optional" />
Specifies the network protocol to use:
- Allowed values: `TCP` *(default)* or `UDP`
#### httpSupport <Badge type="optional" />
Indicates whether the port is running a web server:
- Default value: `true`
- Set to `false` if a web server isn't running on the port
- Only available with TCP protocol
- Used by Zerops for [public access](/features/access) configuration

### prepareCommands <Badge type="optional" />

Customizes the runtime environment by installing additional dependencies or tools.

### addToRunPrepare <Badge type="optional" />

Defines files or folders to be copied from the build container to the prepare runtime container.

### initCommands <Badge type="optional" />

Defines commands to run each time a new runtime container starts or restarts.

```yaml
run:
  initCommands:
    - rm -rf ./cache
```

### start <Badge type="required-some"/>

Defines the start command for your application.

```yaml
run:
  start: npm start
```

### startCommands <Badge type="optional" />

Defines start commands 

Unlike `start`, you can define multiple commands that starts their own processes.

```yaml
run:
  startCommands:
    # start the application
    - command: npm run start:prod
      name: server
    # start the replication
    
    - command: litestream replicate -config=litestream.yaml
      name: replication
      # restore the database on container init
      initCommands:
        - litestream restore -if-replica-exists -if-db-not-exists -config=litestream.yaml $DB_NAME
```

See [start-commands-example](https://github.com/zeropsio/start-commands-example)

### documentRoot <Badge type="optional" />

Customizes the root folder for publicly accessible web server content (available only for webserver runtimes).

### siteConfigPath <Badge type="optional" />

Sets the custom webserver configuration (available only for webserver runtimes).

### envVariables <Badge text="Optional" color="#202e57" />

Defines environment variables for the runtime environment.

```yaml
    run:
      base: nodejs@20
      envVariables:
        DB_NAME: db
        DB_HOST: db

  ```yaml
  run:
    crontab:
      - command: "date >> /var/log/cron.log"
        timing: "0 * * * *"
  ```

Setup cron jobs. See [examples](/references/cron).

## Deploy Configuration

### readinessCheck <Badge type="optional" />

Defines a readiness check for your application. (See [readiness checks](/features/pipeline#readiness-checks))

```yaml
deploy:
  readinessCheck:
    httpGet:
      port: 80
      path: /status
      host: 127.0.0.1
