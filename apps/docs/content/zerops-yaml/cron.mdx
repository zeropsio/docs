description: Learn how to set up automated tasks and scheduled jobs in Zerops
---

Cron jobs are scheduled commands that execute automatically inside a service's containers based on defined timing rules.

In Zerops, these jobs are configured in the `run` section of `zerops.yaml` file under the `crontab` key.

## Parameters

### command
*string, REQUIRED*

The shell command to execute at the scheduled time. This can be any valid command.

### timing
*string, REQUIRED*

The schedule for when the task should run, specified in standard cron format using five space-separated fields:
  - Minute (0–59)
  - Hour (0–23)
  - Day of the month (1–31)
  - Month (1–12)
  - Day of the week (0–7; both 0 and 7 represent Sunday)

#### Examples
  - `"0 5 * * *"` – Runs daily at 5:00 AM.
  - `"*/10 * * * *"` – Runs every 10 minutes.

### allContainers
*boolean, REQUIRED*

**Options:**
- `true` – Command runs on all containers.
- `false` – Command runs on only one container.

### workingDir
*string, REQUIRED*

Specifies the directory where the command will be executed. If not set, it defaults to `/var/www`.

## Example Configurations
Here’s a basic example of how to set up a cron job in your service's `zerops.yaml`:

```yaml
run: 
  crontab:
    - command: "date >> /var/log/cron.log"
      timing: "0 * * * *"
```
This configuration logs the current date to `/var/log/cron.log` every hour.

### Running on Multiple Containers
By default, cron jobs run on a single container, even if multiple containers exist for the service. To execute a command across all containers, you can use the `allContainers` parameter:

```yaml
run: 
  crontab:
    - command: "rm -rf /tmp/*"
      timing: "0 0 * * *"
      allContainers: true
```
This example removes temporary files from all containers every day at midnight.

### Custom Working Directory
You can also specify a custom working directory for your commands using the `workingDir` parameter:

```yaml
run: 
  crontab:
    - command: "php artisan schedule:run"
      timing: "* * * * *"
      workingDir: /var/www/html
```
In this case, the command runs every minute in the `/var/www/html` directory.

### Multiple Cronjobs
It is possible to define multiple cron jobs as a YAML object list under the `crontab` key.

```yaml
run:
  crontab:
    - command: ...
      ...
    - command: ...
      ...
```
