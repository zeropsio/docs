Zerops provides a fully managed [Typesense search engine](https://typesense.org/) service that combines developer productivity with enterprise-grade reliability. The platform handles infrastructure complexity through automated deployment, scaling, and maintenance while providing developers full access to Typesense's native capabilities.

## Supported Versions

Currently supported Typesense version:
<UnorderedList data={data.typesense.readable}/>

Import configuration version:
<UnorderedCodeList data={data.typesense.import}/>

## Service Configuration

Our Typesense implementation comes with carefully tuned defaults that diverge from the [standard Typesense configuration](https://typesense.org/docs/27.1/api/server-configuration.html#using-command-line-arguments) in the following ways:

```yaml
thread-pool-size: 16
num-collections-parallel-load: 8
```

These defaults are optimized for most common use cases and managed by the platform. If you need to adjust these settings, please contact us through our [support channels](#support).

### Deployment Modes

:::warning
The choice between HA and non-HA mode must be made during service creation and cannot be changed later. Make sure to carefully consider your requirements before deploying.
:::

#### Non-HA Mode
- Suitable for development and testing
- Data persistence not guaranteed during node failures
- Lower resource requirements

#### HA Mode
- Implements Typesense's native [**Raft consensus**](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/high-availability.html) mechanism for data replication
- Deploys as a **3-node cluster by default** for optimal reliability
  - Scaling configuration of 3-5 or 3-7 nodes for higher workloads is possible upon request (contact [support](#support) to configure custom node ranges)
- Includes **built-in data synchronization** across all nodes
- Features **automatic leader election** to maintain cluster availability
  - Recovery typically takes up to 1 minute during node failures or leader transitions
  - During these periods, requests may temporarily receive `503 Not Ready or Lagging` or `500 Could not find a leader` responses
  - These states automatically resolve once consensus is reestablished

### API Key Management

The master API key is automatically generated and managed by the platform. You can access it through:
- The service access details in the Zerops GUI
- The `apiKey` environment variable in your service configuration

:::warning
Currently, as a security-focused design decision, the master API key cannot be modified after generation.
:::

### CORS Configuration

Your Typesense instance comes with CORS enabled by default, ensuring seamless integration with frontend applications. Browser-based clients can directly access the instance by providing the `X-Typesense-Api-Key` header, maintaining security while enabling straightforward client-side implementation.

## Network Architecture & Access Patterns

### Access Methods

#### HTTPS Access

When using HTTPS access (either through Zerops subdomain or custom domain), traffic is distributed across nodes via our integrated Nginx proxy layer. This provides a single access point that handles load balancing automatically.

For enabling HTTPS access:
1. Configure through the [Zerops access documentation](/features/access)
2. Or use `enableSubdomainAccess: true` when [importing](/references/import#service-configuration) a Typesense service

#### Direct Node Access

Allows to access individual nodes using internal DNS:
1. **Via [Zerops VPN](/references/vpn)**
2. **Internal Project Access** - services within the same project can reach nodes directly

Node addressing patterns:
##### Standard format
**Format:**```node{n}.db.{hostname}.zerops```
- e.g. `node1.db.typesenseha.zerops`, `node2.db.typesenseha.zerops`
##### Stable DNS records
**Format:**```node-stable-{n}.db.{hostname}.zerops```
- **maintain consistent IP mapping** until node retirement (scaling down or failure events)
- e.g. `node-stable-1.db.typesenseha.zerops`, `node-stable-2.db.typesenseha.zerops`

## Quick Start Example

Here's a simple example of using Typesense with the JavaScript client:

```javascript
import TypesenseClient from 'typesense'

const client = new TypesenseClient({
  nodes: [{
    host: 'your-service.zerops.dev', // Your Zerops subdomain
    port: '443',
    protocol: 'https'
  }],
  apiKey: process.env.TYPESENSE_API_KEY,
  connectionTimeoutSeconds: 2
})

// Create a collection
await client.collections().create({
  name: 'companies',
  fields: [
    { name: 'company_name', type: 'string' },
    { name: 'num_employees', type: 'int32' },
    { name: 'country', type: 'string', facet: true }
  ],
  default_sorting_field: 'num_employees'
})

// Example search query
const searchResults = await client.collections('companies')
  .documents()
  .search({
    q: 'tech',
    query_by: 'company_name',
    filter_by: 'country:=USA',
    sort_by: 'num_employees:desc'
  })
```

## Best Practices

#### API Key Security
- Never expose the master API key in client-side code
- Generate scoped search-only API keys for frontend applications
- Rotate API keys periodically through your service configuration

#### High Availability
- Implement retry logic in clients for handling temporary unavailability
- Use stable DNS records for direct node access when needed

#### Performance Optimization
- Utilize batch operations for bulk updates
- Configure appropriate timeout values based on your use case
- Consider data volume when designing collection schemas
