Zerops manages environment variables at two scopes: service level and project level. These variables are handled automatically without requiring `.env` files.

## Service Variables

Variables that are specific to individual [services](/features/infrastructure#services).

### User-Defined Variables

You can define service-level variables in two ways:

#### 1. Build & Runtime Variables

These variables are defined with `envVariables` attribute in the [build](/zerops-yaml/specification#envvariables-) or [run](/zerops-yaml/specification#envvariables--1) section of your `zerops.yaml` file and are accessible within their respective containers.

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
...
  build:
    envVariables:
      DB_NAME: db
      DB_HOST: 127.0.0.1
      DB_USER: db
      DB_PASS: password
    ...
  run:
    envVariables:
      DB_NAME: db
      DB_HOST: 127.0.0.1
      DB_USER: db
      DB_PASS: password
```

See how to [reference variables](#referencing-variables) between services and between build and runtime environments.

:::note
Your application must be redeployed when updating environmental variables in `zerops.yaml`.
:::

#### 2. Secret Variables

For storing sensitive data you don't want in your source repository. They can be updated without redeployment (though services need to be reloaded).

Secret variables can be managed through:

##### GUI Interface

Navigate to service details and find **Environment variables** in the menu. You can:
- Add individual variables using the "Add secret variable" button
- Edit individual variables through the menu that appears on hover
- Use the bulk editor for managing multiple variables in .env format

<p align="center">
    <Image
    lightImage="/img/screenshots/secret_variables.webp"
    darkImage="/img/screenshots/secret_variables.webp"
    alt="Runtime Secret Variables"
    />
</p>

##### Import Configuration

Create secret variables for a service with `envSecrets` attribute. See the complete [import.yaml structure](/references/import).

```yaml title="import.yaml"
services:
  ...
  envSecrets:
    S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: 'your-secret-s3-key'
    S3_ACCESS_SECRET: 'your-s3-access-secret'
```

### System-Generated Variables

Zerops automatically generates variables based on service type.

These variables cannot be deleted and are always listed at the bottom of the environment variables page. Some are read-only (like `hostname`), while others can be edited (like `PATH`).

These variables can also be [referenced](#referencing-variables).

## Project Variables

Variables that apply across all services within a [project](/features/infrastructure#projects). These provide a way to share common configuration across services.

They work similarly to service secret variables but at project scope - they're managed through the GUI and can be updated without redeployment (though services need to be reloaded).

### User-Defined Variables

You can set project-wide variables through:

#### GUI Interface

Access **Project environment variables** in your project detail to:
- Add individual variables one by one
- Edit individual variables
- Use the bulk editor with .env format

#### Import Configuration

Create project variables with `envVariables` attribute. See the complete [import.yaml structure](/references/import).

```yaml title="import.yaml"
project:
  ...
  envVariables:
    LOG_LEVEL: info
    API_VERSION: v1
```

### System-Generated Variables

Zerops automatically generates project-level variables that can be [referenced](#referencing-variables) from services.

## Environment Variable Isolation

A security feature that controls the **visibility** of environment variables across services within a project.

By default, Zerops isolates environment variables between services to enhance security and prevent unintended access to sensitive information. This isolation can be configured at both project and service levels.

### Isolation Modes

Zerops supports two isolation modes:

<table className="w-full my-1.5">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th className="w-fit">Mode</th>
      <th className="w-fit">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap"><code>service</code></td>
      <td className="w-full"><strong>Default mode.</strong> Variables are isolated to their respective services. Services can only access their own variables and must explicitly reference variables from other services.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit whitespace-nowrap"><code>none</code></td>
      <td className="w-full"><i>Legacy mode.</i> All variables from all services are automatically shared and accessible via prefixing.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Configuring Isolation

#### Project-Level Isolation

Zerops automatically creates the `envIsolation` project variable with the default value `service`. You only need to modify this if you want to disable isolation:

```yaml title="import.yaml"
project:
  envIsolation: none  # Disables isolation, sharing all variables
```

This can also be set through the Project Environment Variables section in the GUI.

#### Service-Level Override

Individual services can override the project-level isolation setting:

```yaml title="import.yaml"
services:
  - hostname: db
    envIsolation: none  # This service's variables will be visible to all services
```

:::tip
You might set a database service to `envIsolation: none` to expose its connection details to other services, without having to manually reference them, while keeping the rest of your services isolated.
:::

:::note
In import YAML, `envIsolation` can also be nested under `envVariables`/`envSecrets`. (If both are present, the nested version takes precedence).
:::

### Accessing Variables Across Services

#### With Isolation Enabled (`service` mode)

When isolation is enabled, you must explicitly create reference variables to access variables from other services:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
# In the 'app' service:
run:
  envVariables:
    # Create a local reference to the 'password' variable from the 'db' service
    DB_PASSWORD: ${db_password}
```

This approach gives you complete control over which variables are shared between services.

#### With Isolation Disabled (`none` mode)

When isolation is disabled, variables are automatically available across all services with the service name prefix:

```yaml
# In any service, you can directly access:
${db_password}  # Accesses the 'password' variable from the 'db' service
```

### Best Practices for Variable Isolation

1. **Use Default Isolation**: Keep the default `service` isolation for enhanced security.
2. **Explicit References**: Create explicit references only for variables that need to be shared.
3. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear naming patterns for reference variables (e.g. `DB_PASSWORD` for a reference to `db_password`).
4. **Service-Level Exceptions**: Use service-level isolation overrides sparingly and only for services that need to expose their variables widely.

## Variable Restrictions

All environment variables must follow these restrictions:

### Key
- Alphanumeric characters only (use `_` to separate words)
- Must be unique within their scope
- Case-sensitive

### Value
- ASCII characters only
- No EOL characters

## Variable Management

### Variable Precedence

When the same environment variable key exists in multiple places, Zerops follows these precedence rules:

1. Service-level variables take precedence over project variables
2. Within service-level:
   - Build/runtime variables override secret variables
   - Build and runtime containers are separate environments

### Referencing Variables

You can reference other variables using the `${variable_name}` syntax:

#### Within Same Service
```yaml
envVariables:
  id: 42069
  hostname: app
  name: ${id}-${hostname}  # Results in: 42069-app
```

#### Across Services

How this works depends on your environment variable isolation setting:

**With Isolation Enabled** (`service` mode - default)
* Create an explicit reference in the destination service:
```yaml
# In the 'app' service
envVariables:
  # Creating a reference to the 'connectionString' from 'dbtest' service
  dbConnection: ${dbtest_connectionString}
```

**With Isolation Disabled** (`none` mode)
* Variables from other services are automatically injected into the container and available using the service prefix format `servicename_variablename`:
```yaml
# In any container, you can directly access variables from other services:
# ${dbtest_connectionString}
```

#### Between Build and Runtime Environments

Build and runtime are two distinct environments in Zerops. Each environment can have its own set of variables, and you can use the same variable names in both environments since they are separate. Due to this separation, variables defined in one are not automatically accessible in the other.

To share variables between environments, you need to use specific prefixes:
- Use `RUNTIME_` prefix to access runtime variables during build
- Use `BUILD_` prefix to access build variables during runtime

Here's an example of `zerops.yaml` file showing how to reference a runtime variable during build:

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
build:
  envVariables:
    API_KEY: ${RUNTIME_API_KEY}  # Using runtime variable during build
run:
  envVariables:
    API_KEY: "12345-abcde"      # Referenced in build with RUNTIME_ prefix
```

#### Project Variables
No prefix needed when referencing project variables:
```yaml title="import.yaml"
project:
  ...
  envVariables:
    projectName: devel
```

```yaml title="zerops.yaml"
envVariables:
  id: 42069
  hostname: app
  name: ${projectName}-${hostname}  # Results in: devel-app
```

## Environment Variable Examples

### Variable Isolation Example

Consider a project with three services: `api`, `db`, and `cache`:

```yaml title="Project structure"
project:
  name: my-project
services:
  - hostname: api
    envSecrets:
      # Creating explicit references to needed variables
      DB_CONNECTION: ${db_user}:${db_password}@${db_hostname}:${db_port}
      CACHE_URL: ${cache_hostname}:${cache_port}
  - hostname: db
    envSecrets:
      password: secureDbPassword
      user: dbuser
      port: 5432
  - hostname: cache
    envSecrets:
      password: cacheServerPass
      port: 6379
```

With this setup:
- The `api` service can only access the specific `db` and `cache` variables it explicitly references
- The `db` service cannot see any variables from `api` or `cache`
- The `cache` service cannot see any variables from `api` or `db`

If we changed the project's `envIsolation` to `none`, all services would be able to see all variables from all other services (prefixed with the service name).
