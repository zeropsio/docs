Zerops manages environment variables at two scopes: service level and project level. These variables are handled automatically without requiring `.env` files.

## Service Variables

Variables that are specific to individual [services](/features/infrastructure#services).

### User-Defined Variables

You can define service-level variables in two ways:

#### 1. Build & Runtime Variables

These variables are defined with `envVariables` attribute in the `build` or `run` section of your [zerops.yml](/zerops-yml/specification) file and are accessible within their respective containers.

```yml title="zerops.yml"
...
  build:
    envVariables:
      DB_NAME: db
      DB_HOST: 127.0.0.1
      DB_USER: db
      DB_PASS: password
    ...
  run:
    envVariables:
      DB_NAME: db
      DB_HOST: 127.0.0.1
      DB_USER: db
      DB_PASS: password
```

See how to [reference variables](#referencing-variables) between services and deployment phases.

:::note
Your application must be redeployed when updating environmental variables in `zerops.yml`.
:::

#### 2. Secret Variables

For storing sensitive data you don't want in your source repository. They can be updated without redeployment (though services need to be restarted).

Secret variables can be managed through:

##### GUI Interface

Navigate to service details and find **Environment variables** in the menu. You can:
- Add individual variables using the "Add secret variable" button
- Edit individual variables through the menu that appears on hover
- Use the bulk editor for managing multiple variables in .env format

    alt="Runtime Secret Variables"
    />
</p>

##### Import Configuration

Create secret variables for a service with `envSecrets` attribute. See the complete [import.yml structure](/reference/import).

```yml title="import.yml"
services:
  ...
  envSecrets:
    S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: 'your-secret-s3-key'
    S3_ACCESS_SECRET: 'your-s3-access-secret'
```

### System-Generated Variables

Zerops automatically generates variables based on service type.

These variables cannot be deleted and are always listed at the bottom of the environment variables page. Some are read-only (like `hostname`), while others can be edited (like `PATH`).

These variables can also be [referenced](#referencing-variables).

## Project Variables

Variables that apply across all services within a [project](/features/infrastructure#project). These provide a way to share common configuration across services.

They work similarly to service secret variables but at project scope - they're managed through the GUI and can be updated without redeployment (though services need to be restarted).

### User-Defined Variables

You can set project-wide variables through:

#### GUI Interface

Access **Project environment variables** in your project detail to:
- Add individual variables one by one
- Edit individual variables
- Use the bulk editor with .env format:

#### Import Configuration

Create project variables with `envVariables` attribute. See the complete [import.yml structure](/reference/import).

```yml title="import.yml"
project:
  ...
  envVariables:
    LOG_LEVEL: info
    API_VERSION: v1
```

### System-Generated Variables

Zerops automatically generates project-level variables containing that can be [referenced](#referencing-variables) from services.

## Variable Restrictions

All environment variables must follow these restrictions:

### Key
- Alphanumeric characters only (use `_` to separate words)
- Must be unique within their scope
- Case-sensitive

### Value
- ASCII characters only
- No EOL characters

## Variable Management

### Variable Precedence

When the same environment variable key exists in multiple places, Zerops follows these precedence rules:

1. Service-level variables take precedence over project variables
2. Within service-level:
   - Build/runtime variables override secret variables
   - Build and runtime containers are separate environments

### Referencing Variables

You can reference other variables using the `${variable_name}` syntax:

#### Within Same Service
```yml
envVariables:
  id: 42069
  hostname: app
  name: ${id}-${hostname}  # Results in: 42069-app
```

#### Across Services
Prefix variables with their respective service name:
```yml
setup: dbtest
  run:
    envVariables:
      connectionString: 127.0.0.1

setup: app
  run:
    envVariables:
      dbConnection: ${dbtest_connectionString}
```

#### Between Build and Runtime
Prefix variables with `RUNTIME_` or `BUILD_`:
```yml
build:
  envVariables:
    variable: ${RUNTIME_someVariable}
run:
  envVariables:
    someVariable: hello world
```

#### Project Variables
No prefix needed when referencing project variables:
```yml title="import.yml"
project:
  ...
  envVariables:
    projectName: devel
```

```yml title="zerops.yml"
envVariables:
  id: 42069
  hostname: app
  name: ${projectName}-${hostname}  # Results in: devel-app
```
