title: Cloudflare DNS Configuration for Zerops
description: Complete guide for configuring Cloudflare DNS records and proxy settings with your Zerops applications, including SSL/TLS setup and troubleshooting.
---

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring Cloudflare to work with your Zerops applications, covering DNS records, proxy settings, SSL/TLS configuration, and common troubleshooting scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A Cloudflare account
- A registered domain name
- Access to your Zerops project with [domain access configured](/features/access#public-access-through-your-domain)
- Your Zerops IP addresses (IPv4 and/or IPv6) from the Zerops GUI

## DNS Record Configuration

Configure your DNS records in Cloudflare using one of these approaches based on your needs:

### With Cloudflare Proxy

#### IPv6 only
```bash
Type    Name              Content                Proxy status   TTL
AAAA    <your-domain>     <your-project-ipv6>    Proxied        Auto
```

Cloudflare handles IPv4 to IPv6 translation, making your service accessible to both IPv4 and IPv6 users. Uses Zerops' free dedicated IPv6 address.

:::note
Do not add a proxied A record with shared IPv4 when using this setup, as it would prevent proper IPv4 traffic routing.
:::

#### Dedicated IPv4
```bash
Type    Name              Content                Proxy status   TTL
A       <your-domain>     <your-dedicated-ipv4>  Proxied        Auto
# Optional
AAAA    <your-domain>     <your-project-ipv6>    Proxied        Auto
```

Uses your dedicated IPv4 address with Cloudflare's proxy features.

:::tip
Adding the AAAA record allows visitors with IPv6 support to connect directly via IPv6.
:::

#### Shared IPv4 *(not recommended)*
```bash
Type    Name              Content                Proxy status  TTL
AAAA    <your-domain>     <your-project-ipv6>    DNS only      Auto
A       <your-domain>     <zerops-shared-ipv4>   Proxied       Auto
```

:::tip Why Not?
Creates inconsistent security posture by mixing direct and proxied connections. Consider using IPv6 only or dedicated IPv4 configurations instead.
:::

### DNS-Only Configuration (Without Cloudflare Proxy)

If you prefer direct connections without Cloudflare's proxy features:

#### Shared IPv4
```bash
Type    Name              Content                Proxy status   TTL
A       <your-domain>     <zerops-shared-ipv4>   DNS only       Auto
AAAA    <your-domain>     <your-project-ipv6>    DNS only       Auto
```

Uses Zerops' free shared IPv4.

:::note Both A + AAAA Required
Adding AAAA record is essential for shared IPv4 configuration as it serves as a [security measure](/features/dns#understand-shared-ipv4) to prevent unauthorized domain claims.
:::

#### Dedicated IPv4
```bash
Type    Name              Content                Proxy status   TTL
A       <your-domain>     <your-dedicated-ipv4>  DNS only       Auto
# Optional
AAAA    <your-domain>     <your-project-ipv6>    DNS only       Auto
```

Uses your dedicated IPv4 address.
:::tip
Adding the AAAA record allows visitors with IPv6 support to connect directly via IPv6.
:::

#### IPv6 only
```bash
Type    Name              Content                Proxy status   TTL
AAAA    <your-domain>     <your-project-ipv6>    DNS only       Auto
```

Uses only Zerops' free dedicated IPv6.
:::note
This configuration will only work for users with IPv6 connectivity.
:::

## Wildcard Domain Configuration

Zerops supports wildcard domains (`*.<your-domain>`) that allow routing all subdomains to your project.

### DNS Records for Wildcards

Configure wildcard domains using either method:

#### Method A: Direct Wildcard Records
```bash
Type   Name              Content               Proxy status       TTL
A      *.<your-domain>   <your-ipv4-address>   DNS only/Proxied   Auto
AAAA   *.<your-domain>   <your-ipv6-address>   DNS only/Proxied   Auto
```

#### Method B: CNAME to Main Domain
First ensure your main domain has proper A/AAAA records, then add:
```bash
Type    Name              Content         Proxy status       TTL
CNAME   *.<your-domain>   <your-domain>   DNS only/Proxied   Auto
```

### Certificate Validation for Wildcards

To enable automatic SSL certificate issuance for wildcard domains:

```bash
Type    Name                            Content                     Proxy status   TTL
CNAME   _acme-challenge.<your-domain>   <your-domain>.zerops.zone   DNS only       Auto
```

This CNAME record allows Zerops to handle the DNS-01 challenge required for wildcard SSL certificates.

### Higher-Level Wildcard Subdomains

You can also set up higher-level wildcard subdomains like `*.<subdomain>.<your-domain>`:

#### Method A: Direct Configuration
```bash
Type   Name                          Content               Proxy status       TTL
A      *.<subdomain>.<your-domain>   <your-ipv4-address>   DNS only/Proxied   Auto
AAAA   *.<subdomain>.<your-domain>   <your-ipv6-address>   DNS only/Proxied   Auto
```

#### Method B: Using a CNAME Record
```bash
Type    Name                          Content                     Proxy status       TTL
CNAME   *.<subdomain>.<your-domain>   <subdomain>.<your-domain>   DNS only/Proxied   Auto
```
or
```bash
Type    Name                          Content         Proxy status       TTL
CNAME   *.<subdomain>.<your-domain>   <your-domain>   DNS only/Proxied   Auto
```

For certificate validation with higher-level wildcards:
```bash
Type    Name                                        Content                                 Proxy status   TTL
CNAME   _acme-challenge.<subdomain>.<your-domain>   <subdomain>.<your-domain>.zerops.zone   DNS only       Auto
```

### Combining Main Domain and Wildcard Domain

To use both `<your-domain>` and `*.<your-domain>`, specify both variants in your [Zerops configuration](/features/access#configuring-http-routing). Zerops automatically issues a single shared certificate for both the main domain and all its subdomains.

## Cloudflare SSL/TLS Configuration

### Essential SSL/TLS Settings

1. **Set Encryption Mode**
   - Navigate to **SSL/TLS** → **Overview** in your Cloudflare dashboard
   - Select **Full (strict)** for production or **Full** for testing
   - **Never use Flexible mode** - this will cause redirect loops

2. **Edge Certificates**
   - Go to **SSL/TLS** → **Edge Certificates**
   - Ensure **Always Use HTTPS** is enabled for production
   - Keep **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites** enabled

### Certificate Validation Configuration

For proper certificate issuance, especially with Let's Encrypt:

#### Option A: Simple Setup (Testing/Development)
- Temporarily disable **Always Use HTTPS** during initial certificate setup
- Re-enable after certificates are issued

#### Option B: Production Setup
Keep **Always Use HTTPS** enabled and create a Configuration Rule:

1. Go to **Rules** → **Configuration Rules**
2. Create a new rule with these settings:
   - **Rule name:** "Allow ACME Challenge"
   - **Field:** URI Path
   - **Operator:** starts with
   - **Value:** `/.well-known/acme-challenge/`
   - **Action:** Disable **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites**

This rule allows certificate validation to work while maintaining HTTPS enforcement for all other traffic.

## Validation and Testing

### DNS Resolution Testing
```bash
# Check IPv4 resolution
dig A <your-domain>

# Check IPv6 resolution
dig AAAA <your-domain>

# Check from specific DNS server
dig @1.1.1.1 <your-domain>
```

### Connectivity Testing
```bash
# Basic HTTPS test
curl -vI https://<your-domain>

# Test with specific subdomain (for wildcards)
curl -vI https://api.<your-domain>

# Test IPv4 specifically
curl -4 -v https://<your-domain>

# Test IPv6 specifically
curl -6 -v https://<your-domain>
```

### Cloudflare-Specific Checks

1. **Verify proxy status** in Cloudflare DNS dashboard (orange cloud = proxied)
2. **Check SSL/TLS mode** in SSL/TLS → Overview
3. **Confirm certificate issuance** in SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates
4. **Test redirect behavior** by accessing `http://` version of your domain

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### SSL Certificate Problems

**Symptom:** "Too many redirects" or SSL errors
**Solutions:**
- Verify SSL/TLS mode is set to **Full** or **Full (strict)**, not **Flexible**
- Check that both Zerops and Cloudflare have valid certificates
- Ensure **Always Use HTTPS** is properly configured
- For new domains, refresh the Cloudflare SSL/TLS page as settings may display incorrectly initially

**Symptom:** Certificate validation fails for wildcard domains
**Solutions:**
- Verify the `_acme-challenge` CNAME record is correctly configured
- Ensure DNS propagation is complete (check with `dig` command)
- Check that the CNAME points to `<your-domain>.zerops.zone`

### DNS Resolution Issues

**Symptom:** Domain not resolving
**Solutions:**
- Confirm DNS records are correctly configured in Cloudflare
- Verify proxy status matches your intended setup
- Check for typos in IP addresses
- Wait for DNS propagation (typically 5-10 minutes)

**Symptom:** IPv4 traffic not working with IPv6-only setup
**Solutions:**
- Ensure Cloudflare proxy is enabled (orange cloud)
- Verify IPv6 address is correct in AAAA record
- Confirm no conflicting A record with shared IPv4 exists

## Security Considerations

- Always use **Full (strict)** SSL mode for production
- Enable **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** in Cloudflare
- Consider enabling **Bot Fight Mode** for additional protection
- Use Cloudflare's **Firewall Rules** to block malicious traffic
- Regularly monitor SSL certificate expiration dates
