title: DNS and Proxy Configuration Guide
desc: A comprehensive guide for configuring DNS records and proxy settings with Zerops applications, including shared and dedicated IPv4 setups, security measures, and troubleshooting tips.
---

This guide will show you how to configure DNS records and proxy settings to work with your Zerops applications, with specific implementation details for Cloudflare.

## DNS Configuration

DNS records for Zerops services can be configured in two main ways:
* **With Proxy**: Routes traffic through proxy services, providing additional security and performance features
* **Without Proxy (DNS Only)**: Direct connection to your Zerops service's IP address

DNS allows you to set two records based on IP address type:
* **A** record for **IPv4** - Zerops offers either a free **shared** IPv4 or a paid **dedicated** IPv4
* **AAAA** record for **IPv6** - Zerops provides a free **dedicated** IPv6

### With Proxy

#### IPv6 only
```bash
Type    Name      Content                Proxy status   TTL
AAAA    <name>    <your-project-ipv6>    Proxied        Auto
```

:::note
Make sure your proxy service supports IPv4 to IPv6 translation for this configuration to work for **both IPv4 and IPv6** users.

Do not add a proxied A record with shared IPv4 - doing so would prevent the proxy from properly routing IPv4 traffic to your service.
:::

#### Dedicated IPv4
```bash
Type    Name      Content                Proxy status   TTL
A       <name>    <your-dedicated-ipv4>  Proxied        Auto
# Optional
AAAA    <name>    <your-project-ipv6>    Proxied        Auto
```

:::tip
Adding also AAAA record can be beneficial as visitors with IPv6 support will connect directly via IPv6.
:::

#### Shared IPv4 *(valid but NOT recommended)*
```bash
Type    Name      Content                Proxy status  TTL
AAAA    <name>    <your-project-ipv6>    DNS only      Auto
A       <name>    <zerops-shared-ipv4>   Proxied       Auto
```

:::tip Why not?
It does not make sense to expose your IPv6 address while proxying the shared IPv4. Use [IPv6 only](#ipv6-only) setup instead.
:::

### Without Proxy

#### Shared IPv4
```bash
Type    Name      Content                Proxy status   TTL
AAAA    <name>    <your-project-ipv6>    DNS only       Auto
A       <name>    <zerops-shared-ipv4>   DNS only       Auto
```

:::note Both A + AAAA Required
Adding AAAA record is essential for shared IPv4 configuration as it serves as a [security measure](#understand-shared-ipv4) to prevent unauthorized domain claims.
:::

#### Dedicated IPv4
```bash
Type    Name      Content                Proxy status   TTL
A       <name>    <your-dedicated-ipv4>  DNS only       Auto
# Optional
AAAA    <name>    <your-project-ipv6>    DNS only       Auto
```

:::tip
Adding also AAAA record can be beneficial as visitors with IPv6 support will connect directly via IPv6.
:::

#### IPv6 only
```bash
Type    Name      Content                Proxy status   TTL
AAAA    <name>    <your-project-ipv6>    DNS only       Auto
```

:::note
This configuration will only work for users with IPv6 connectivity, which may limit your service accessibility.

### Understanding Shared IPv4 Addresses {#understand-shared-ipv4}

Shared IPv4 allows multiple Zerops projects to use the same IPv4 address while maintaining separate routing for each project. Here's how it works:

1. When a visitor makes a request, it first arrives at the shared IPv4 address
2. The system looks at the domain name in the request (using SNI - Server Name Indication)
3. For security, it checks if this domain properly resolves to your project's IPv6 address
4. Only if IPv6 address matches your project will the traffic be routed correctly

This is why configuring both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records is crucial when using shared IPv4 addresses - the IPv6 record acts as a security key that helps prevent unauthorized use of the shared IPv4 address.

### Best Practices

#### Security
- Enable proxy protection for DDoS mitigation when available
- Review firewall rules regularly

#### Performance
- Enable Auto Minify and Brotli Compression
- Configure appropriate cache rules
- Monitor analytics and metrics
- Review bandwidth usage patterns

## General Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **DNS Resolution Issues**
   - Confirm correct record configuration
   - Verify proxy status settings
   - Check IPv6 address accuracy
   - Allow time for DNS propagation (typically 5-10 minutes)
   - Verify DNS resolver settings

2. **Connection Problems**
   - Test both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity
   - Verify firewall rules
   - Check proxy server status if applicable
   - Confirm port configurations

### Validation Steps

Test your configuration:
```bash
# Check DNS resolution
dig AAAA yourdomain.com

# Verify connectivity
curl -vI https://yourdomain.com

# Test IPv4 access
curl -4 -v https://yourdomain.com

# Test IPv6 access
curl -6 -v https://yourdomain.com
```

## Cloudflare Configuration

### SSL/TLS Mode
Set encryption mode to `Full (strict)` or `Full`
   - Ensures end-to-end encryption
   - *Full* mode requires any SSL certificate (even if self-signed/expired), while *Full (strict)* requires a valid certificate

### Certificate Management
1. Enable Edge Certificates to allow Cloudflare to manage SSL/TLS certificates
2. During initial setup, handle HTTPS settings in one of two ways:
   - **Option A (Simple but Limited)**:
     - Disable `Always Use HTTPS`
     - *This approach will interfere with automatic certificate renewal*
   - **Option B (Recommended for Production)**:
     - Keep `Always Use HTTPS` enabled
     - Create and enable a Configuration Rule, which disables Automatic HTTPS Rewrites for this specific path:
       ```
       Field: URI Path
       Operator: starts with
       Value: /.well-known/acme-challenge/
       ```
       This rule disables Automatic HTTPS Rewrites for the certificate validation path.

### Cloudflare Troubleshooting

#### SSL Certificate Problems
   - Verify `Always Use HTTPS` is disabled
   - If you encounter **too many redirects** or similar SSL errors:
       - Double-check that SSL/TLS encryption mode is set to *Full* or *Full (strict)*, not *Flexible*
       - SSL mode might show incorrectly for newly added domains, try refreshing the page if settings appear incorrect
