# Understanding Zerops Build Cache

> Zerops implements a sophisticated two-layer caching strategy that optimizes build times while maintaining complete control over the build environment. This documentation explores the architecture, configuration patterns, and practical implementation of the build cache system.

## Architecture Overview

The build cache operates through two distinct layers:

1. **Base Layer**: Comprises the OS, installed dependencies, and prepare commands
2. **Build Layer**: Contains the state after executing build commands

The layers work together to create an efficient and predictable build environment, though they are currently coupled in their cache invalidation behavior (invalidating one layer affects the other).

### Cache Implementation

The caching mechanism is implemented through an efficient file movement strategy. This approach ensures near-instantaneous cache operations through simple directory relocation within the container, implementing the following characteristics:

- Files are moved between `/build/source` and `/build/cache` using container-level rename operations
- No packaging, compression, or network transfer is involved
- Cache preservation is achieved through simple directory relocation within the container
- Files maintain their original state and permissions throughout the process

## Configuration Guide

### Essential zerops.yaml Fields

The following fields in `zerops.yaml` affect build cache behavior:

**Direct Cache Configuration**:
- `build.cache`: Explicitly defines what should be cached through paths or patterns

**Cache Invalidation Triggers**:
These parameters trigger cache invalidation when modified:
- `build.os`: Base operating system selection
- `build.base`: Pre-installed software stacks and runtimes
- `build.prepareCommands`: System preparation and dependency installation
- `build.cache`: Changes to cache configuration

**Build Artifact Generation**:
- `build.buildCommands`: Generates the build artifact that will be deployed.

## Cache Configuration Patterns

### Pattern 1: System-Wide Cache Control
```yaml
build:
  cache: true   # Cache everything
  # OR
  cache: false  # Intended to disable all caching
```

The boolean values provide system-wide cache control:

`cache: true`:
- Preserves the entire build container state
- Maintains system-level package installations
- Ideal for globally installed packages (Python/PHP packages, Go modules)

`cache: false`:
- Intended to disable all caching
- Currently, due to layer coupling, only files within `/build/source` are not cached
- Everything outside `/build/source` remains cached (see [Common Pitfalls: Layer Coupling](#current-pitfalls))

### Pattern 2: Path-Specific Caching
```yaml
# Single path
build:
  cache: node_modules

# Multiple paths
build:
  cache:
    - node_modules
    - package-lock.json
    - .build
```

Execution flow:
1. Source code extraction to `/build/source`
2. Build command execution
3. Specified path preservation in `/build/cache`
4. Cached content restoration (no-clobber mode - source files take precedence)

:::tip
Ideal for non-versioned dependencies in your working directory (e.g., `node_modules`, `vendor`, `.venv`).

## Path Pattern Reference

Zerops supports [Go's filepath.Match](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) syntax. Consider this example structure:

```
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── subdir/
    ├── file1.txt
    ├── file2.txt
    └── file3.md
```

Pattern examples and matches:
```yaml
build:
  cache:
    - "subdir/*.txt"      # Matches: subdir/file1.txt, subdir/file2.txt
    - "package*"          # Matches: package.json, package-lock.json
    - "node_modules"      # Matches: entire node_modules directory recursively
```

:::note
All patterns resolve relative to `/build/source`. Path variations like `./node_modules`, `node_modules`, and `node_modules/` are treated identically.

## Build Process Lifecycle

1. **Initialization Phase**
   - Build container startup
   - Builder process launch
   - Source code loading into `/build/source`

2. **Cache Restoration Phase**
   - Cached file movement to `/build/source` (no-clobber mode)
   - Source file precedence handling
   - Conflict logging (no build interruption)
   - Cache directory cleanup

3. **Build Execution Phase**
   - Build command processing
   - Artifact packaging (`build.deployFiles`)

4. **Cache Preservation Phase**
   - Specific cache files movement outside `/build/source`
   - `/build/source` directory cleanup
   - Container termination

## Cache Invalidation Reference

The build cache invalidates under these conditions:

1. **Manual Triggers**
   - API call: `DELETE /service-stack/{id}/build-cache`
   - GUI: Manual cache clear action

2. **Version Management**
   - Backup app version activation via `PUT /app-version/{id}/deploy`

3. **Configuration Changes**
   Any modifications to:
   ```yaml
   build.os
   build.base
   build.prepareCommands
   build.cache
   ```

### Current Pitfalls

The current implementation has some important characteristics:

1. **Layer Coupling**
   ```yaml
   build:
     base: go@1
     prepareCommands:
       - sudo apk update
       - sudo apk add sqlite
     buildCommands:
       - go build -o app main.go
     cache: false
   ```
   Even with `cache: false`, Go modules outside `/build/source` remain cached.

2. **Cascade Invalidation**
   ```yaml
   build:
     base: node@22
     prepareCommands:
       - sudo apk update
       - sudo apk add sqlite vim  # Adding 'vim' invalidates everything
     buildCommands:
       - npm install
       - npm build
     cache:
       - node_modules
   ```
   Modifying `prepareCommands` invalidates both layers, including cached `node_modules`.

## Real-World Implementation Examples

### Node.js Project with TypeScript
```yaml
build:
  base: node@22
  buildCommands:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build
  cache:
    - node_modules
    - .next
    - .turbo
    - package-lock.json
```

### Go Project with Multiple Dependencies
```yaml
build:
  base: go@1
  prepareCommands:
    - sudo apk add build-base
  buildCommands:
    - go mod download
    - go build -o bin/app cmd/main.go
  cache: true  # Caches entire Go modules directory
```

### PHP/Laravel Project
```yaml
build:
  base: php@8.3
  buildCommands:
    - composer install --no-dev
    - php artisan optimize
  cache:
    - vendor
    - composer.lock
```

## Debugging and Monitoring

* **Build Logs**
   - Cache operations are detailed in build logs
   - File conflicts during restoration are logged
   - Cache preservation status is visible

## Implementation Best Practices

### Cache Strategy Optimization

1. **Layer Management**
   - Maintain stable `prepareCommands` to prevent cache invalidation
   - Group related prepare commands logically

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache package manager lock files alongside dependency directories
   - Use system-wide caching (`cache: true`) for languages with global package managers

3. **Performance Tuning**
   - Leverage system-wide caching for complex builds
   - Monitor build logs for cache operations and potential conflicts
   - Use explicit patterns for precise control
   - Don't over-optimize – the system handles large caches efficiently

## Future Development

Planned system enhancements include:
- Layer independence implementation
- Granular cache control mechanisms
- Enhanced layer management capabilities
- Improved cache invalidation patterns
