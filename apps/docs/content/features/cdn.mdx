Zerops CDN is a global content delivery network that brings your static content closer to your users, resulting in faster load times and improved user experience. Built on Nginx and Cloudflare geo-steering technology, our CDN automatically routes users to the nearest server location based on their DNS request.

## Key Benefits

- **Global Reach**: Serve content from strategic locations across the world
- **Reduced Latency**: Content is delivered from the server closest to your users
- **Simple Integration**: No complex configuration required

## Global CDN Infrastructure

Zerops CDN operates across **6 strategic regions** to ensure your content is always delivered from a location close to your users:

### Geo-Steering Technology
Zerops CDN's geo-steering technology automatically routes users to the server location closest to them. Here's how it works:

* **Automatic routing**: Users are directed to the optimal CDN node based on their geographic location
* **Quick failover**: The DNS TTL is set to just 30 seconds, allowing fast recovery if a node fails
* **Redundancy**: If any node becomes unavailable, Cloudflare automatically redirects traffic to the next closest node
* **Reliable backup**: The EU region serves as the ultimate fallback - if all other nodes go down, EU will always be served in DNS

## CDN Modes and Implementation

Zerops CDN currently supports two distinct usage modes (with a third mode coming soon), each designed for specific content delivery needs.

### Object Storage Mode

Perfect for efficiently delivering media files, documents, and other static assets stored in Zerops [Object Storage](/object-storage/overview) to users across different geographical regions.

**Setup process:**
1. Create an Object Storage service or select an existing one
2. Enable the CDN option for this service
3. Set appropriate public read access policies for objects you want to serve via CDN

**Accessing content:**
```txt
https://storage.cdn.zerops.app/your-bucket/path/to/file
```

:::tip
Access the storage CDN URL via the `storageCdnUrl` **project** environment variable `${storageCdnUrl}/your-bucket/path/to/file`.
:::

### Static Mode

Ideal for caching and delivering static website assets like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images served from your custom domains.

**Setup process:**
1. Configure domain access for your service
2. Ensure your domains are DNS-verified and have active SSL certificates
3. Enable CDN for the domain group

**Accessing content:**
```txt
https://static.cdn.zerops.app/your-domain.com/path/to/file
```

:::tip
Access the static CDN URL via the `staticCdnUrl` **project** environment variable `${staticCdnUrl}/your-domain.com/path/to/file`.
:::

:::warning Wildcard Domains Not Supported
Static CDN cannot be activated for wildcard domains (e.g., *.example.com). You must use specific domain names.
:::

### API Mode *(Coming Soon)*

Designed for caching API responses to reduce load on your backend services and deliver faster responses to clients.

**Environment variable:** Once available, you'll be able to access the API CDN URL via the `apiCdnUrl` **project** environment variable.

:::warning
API Mode is currently under development and will be available in a future release.
:::

### HTML Implementation Examples

Here's how to integrate CDN URLs in your HTML code:

```html
<!-- Compare: Direct Object Storage vs. CDN-accelerated Storage -->
<!-- Direct from Object Storage -->
<img src="https://storage-prg1.zerops.io/my-bucket/logo.png"/>

<!-- Via CDN for faster global delivery -->
<img src="https://storage.cdn.zerops.app/my-bucket/logo.png"/>

<!-- Using environment variables in templates -->
<img src="{{ osGetEnv "storageCdnUrl" }}/assets/hero-image.jpg"/>

<!-- Compare: Direct Domain vs. CDN-accelerated Domain -->
<!-- Direct from your domain -->
<script src="/static/js/main.js"></script>

<!-- Via CDN for faster global delivery -->
<script src="https://static.cdn.zerops.app/your-domain.com/static/js/main.js"></script>
```

### Testing Specific CDN Nodes

For testing or debugging purposes, you can bypass the automatic geo-steering and access a specific CDN node directly:

```
https://{region}-{mode}.cdn.zerops.app/path/to/content
```

Available region prefixes: `cz`, `de`, `au`, `sg`, `uk`, and `ca`

**Examples:**
- Test Australia node: `https://au-storage.cdn.zerops.app/my-bucket/test.jpg`
- Test UK node: `https://uk-static.cdn.zerops.app/my-domain.com/index.html`

## Managing CDN Content

### Cache Lifecycle

Content served through Zerops CDN follows this lifecycle:

1. **First Request**: When a user requests content not yet in the CDN cache, the request goes to the origin server (your Zerops service), and the response is cached at the CDN node
2. **Subsequent Requests**: Further requests for the same content are served directly from the CDN cache, reducing latency and origin server load
3. **Cache Expiration**: By default, content remains cached for 30 days unless explicitly purged
4. **Automatic Management**: When CDN storage reaches capacity, the least recently used content is automatically removed

:::note Important Cache Behavior
Zerops CDN implements a fixed 30-day TTL policy. Currently, HTTP caching headers such as `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `Pragma`, etc. do not influence CDN caching behavior. To refresh content sooner than the 30-day period, use the [purge API](#api-reference).

Your `Cache-Control` headers will still affect browser caching behavior.
:::

### When to Purge Cache

You should consider purging cached content when:

- **Content Updates**: You've updated content but kept the same URL (e.g., updated images, CSS files)
- **Deployment Rollouts**: You've deployed a new version of your application
- **Emergency Removal**: You need to immediately remove content that was accidentally made public
- **Testing Changes**: You want to ensure users see the latest version during testing

### Purging Cached Content

Zerops provides multiple ways to manage and purge cached content before its normal expiration:

- **Command Line**: Use the `zsc cdn purge` [command](/references/zsc#cdn) available in all Zerops containers:
  ```sh
  # Purge all content for a domain
  zsc cdn purge example.com

  # Purge specific path
  zsc cdn purge example.com /images/
  ```

- **API Endpoints**: For programmatic control, use the [API endpoints](#api-reference). Here are ready-to-use curl examples for quickly purging content in your scripts:

  ```sh
  # Static mode: Purge all content for a domain
  curl --location --request PUT "https://api.app-prg1.zerops.io/api/rest/public/project/$PROJECT_ID/purge-cdn/static/$DOMAIN/*" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $USER_OR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  ```

  ```sh
  # Storage mode: Purge all content for object storage
  curl --location --request PUT "https://api.app-prg1.zerops.io/api/rest/public/service-stack/$OBJECT_STORAGE_SERVICE_ID/purge-cdn/*" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $USER_OR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  ```

## Troubleshooting

Having issues with your CDN? Here are solutions to the most common problems:

#### Content Not Updated After Changes
* **Issue:** You've updated content, but users still see the old version.
* **Possible Cause:** The CDN cache is continuing to serve the previously cached version.
* **Solution:**
    - Use the [purge API](#api-reference) with the specific content path
    - For immediate changes, use versioned file names (e.g., `style.v2.css` instead of just `style.css`)

#### Content Not Being Cached
* **Issue:** Your content isn't being cached by the CDN.
* **Possible Cause:** Missing public read permissions on objects.
* **Solution:**
    - For object storage: Check bucket and object access policies
    - Verify the object is accessible directly before attempting CDN access

:::note
Remember that only publicly accessible objects will be cached by the CDN. Private objects will always be fetched directly from the origin.
:::

#### Environment Variables Not Available
* **Issue:** You can't access the new CDN-related project level environment variables in your containers.
* **Possible Cause:** When new environment variables are created, existing services need to be restarted to access them. Services created before the CDN feature release require special handling.
* **Solution:**
    - For services created after CDN release: Restart the service to apply the new environment variables
    - For services created before CDN release: Add and then remove a dummy environment variable in the project settings adn restart the service

#### Unexpected 404 Errors
* **Issue:** Users receive 404 errors when accessing content via CDN.
* **Possible Cause:** Incorrect CDN URL formatting or missing content at origin.
* **Solution:**
    - Double-check your [URL structure](#) (pay attention to domain names and paths)
    - Verify content exists at the origin before attempting CDN access
    - Test accessing the content directly from origin first

**Correct URL patterns:**
- Object Storage: `https://storage.cdn.zerops.app/your-bucket/path/to/file`
- Static Mode: `https://static.cdn.zerops.app/your-domain.com/path/to/file`
