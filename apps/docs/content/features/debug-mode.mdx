This document describes the debug mode configuration capabilities for service stacks in Zerops, allowing developers to pause execution at specific points during build and runtime processes for debugging purposes.

## Overview

Debug mode introduces control over two distinct phases of deployment:

- **Build phase** - When the `buildCommands` are executed
- **Runtime prepare phase** - When the `prepareCommands` are executed

For each phase, you can choose when to pause the execution:
- **Disable** - No pausing, execution proceeds normally
- **Before first command** - Execution stops before running any commands
- **After last command** - Execution stops after all commands complete
- **On command fail** - Execution stops when a command fails

Each phase can be configured with its own debug settings without affecting the other phase.

:::warning Important
The entire build process, including any time spent in debug mode, has a maximum duration of 60 minutes. After this time limit is reached, the build process is automatically cancelled.
:::

## Configuration

The debug mode configuration can be found in your service detail under the **Pipelines & CI/CD settings**.

## Debug Control

When execution is paused in debug mode, you have several commands available to control the debugging process. Each command serves a specific purpose and affects the deployment process differently.

### Debug Pause Points

There are three key points where execution can pause during deployment:
- ➠ **Disable** - Do not pause
- ↪ **Before First Command** - Paused before any commands run
- ✖ **On Command Failure** - Paused when a command fails
- ✔ **After Last Command** - Paused after all commands complete

### Available Commands

#### Continuing Execution
To proceed with the normal deployment process, use:
```bash
zsc debug continue
```

<table className="w-full my-1.5 whitespace-nowrap">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th className="">Pause Point</th>
      <th className="w-full">Behavior</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit">↪ <i>Before First Command</i></td>
      <td className="w-fit">Begins running commands for the current phase until next possible pause point</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit">✖ <i>On Command Failure</i></td>
      <td className="w-fit">Skips the failed command and continues deployment</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit">✔ <i>After Last Command</i></td>
      <td className="w-fit">Moves to the next phase (from build to runtime prepare) or completes deployment</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Marking Success
To force a successful deployment status, use:
```bash
zsc debug success
```

<table className="w-full my-1.5 whitespace-nowrap">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th className="">Pause Point</th>
      <th className="w-full">Behavior</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit">↪ <i>Before First Command</i></td>
      <td className="w-fit">Ends current phase without running any commands</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit">✖ <i>On Command Failure</i></td>
      <td className="w-fit">Ignores the failure and ends current phase with success</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit">✔ <i>After Last Command</i></td>
      <td className="w-fit">Concludes current phase with a successful status</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

:::note
Requires valid `deployFiles` to work properly (fails otherwise).
:::

#### Forcing Failure
To terminate the deployment with a failure status, use:
```bash
zsc debug fail
```

<table className="w-full my-1.5 whitespace-nowrap">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th className="">Pause Point</th>
      <th className="w-full">Behavior</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit">↪ <i>Before First Command</i></td>
      <td className="w-fit">Marks current phase as failed without running commands</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit">✖ <i>On Command Failure</i></td>
      <td className="w-fit">Ends deployment with original error</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit">✔ <i>After Last Command</i></td>
      <td className="w-fit">Overwrites successful execution with failed status and ends deployment</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Each phase can be configured independently to pause at any of the points described above, giving you precise control over your debugging workflow. The 60-minute timeout ensures deployments don't remain blocked indefinitely.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Debugging Build Failures

<table className="w-full my-1.5 whitespace-nowrap">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit"><b>Build phase</b></td>
      <td className="w-fit">✖ <i>On Command Failure</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit"><b>Prepare runtime phase</b></td>
      <td className="w-fit">➠ <i>Disable</i></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This configuration allows you to:
1. Inspect the container state after a failure
2. Make necessary adjustments
3. Use `zsc debug continue` to resume or `zsc debug fail` to abort

### Example 2: Validating Runtime Setup

<table className="w-full my-1.5 whitespace-nowrap">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit"><b>Build phase</b></td>
      <td className="w-fit">➠ <i>Disable</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit"><b>Prepare runtime phase</b></td>
      <td className="w-fit">✔ <i>After Last Command</i></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Best Practices

#### Targeted Debugging
- Enable debug mode only for the specific phase you need to investigate
- This minimizes disruption to the deployment process
- Helps maintain clear debugging sessions

#### Clean Up
- Always remember to disable debug mode after completing your debugging session
- Set both phases to **Disable**
- Prevents unexpected pauses in future deployments

#### Production Consideration
- Be cautious when using debug mode in production environments
- Paused executions can block deployments
- Consider using separate development services for extended debugging sessions

#### Timeout Awareness
- Be mindful of the 60-minute maximum debug pause time (plan debugging sessions accordingly)

## Technical Considerations

- Debug mode settings persist until explicitly changed
- Build phase and runtime prepare phase operate independently
- Debug commands are only available when execution is paused
- Success signals require valid `deployFiles` to proceed
