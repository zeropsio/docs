Zerops structure has three levels - **projects**, **services** and **containers**.

## Project

The **project** is the top-level entity, encompassing various **services**. It requires a functioning **core**, which includes:

- Logger and statistics services
- HTTP routing (with SSL certificates)
- IP routing (with built-in firewall)

The core activates when the first user service is deployed and incurs a fixed monthly fee.

### Lightweight Core

Single-container infrastructure with L3 balancer, firewall, logger, and statistics service. Includes HTTP routing with SSL termination, automatic certificate generation, and load balancers. Comes with 15 hours of build time, 5 GB backup space, and 100 GB egress traffic. Ideal for development and smaller production workloads.

### Serious Core

Highly available infrastructure with redundant core services, advanced load balancing, and SSL management. Features 150 hours of build time, 25 GB backup space, and 3 TB egress traffic. Built for production workloads requiring high reliability and scalability.

For detailed information about both core types and their resource limits, visit our [pricing page](/features/pricing#project-plans).

### Key Features

- **Private Network**: All services in a project share a dedicated network and have access to each other's environment variables.
- **IPv6/IPv4**: Each project automatically gets an IPv6 address. An IPv4 address can be added at an extra cost.

:::tip
Create separate projects for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) or use one project shared among developers to save costs.

## Services & Containers

### Services

Services are responsible for encapsulating your containers.
A project can host unlimited **services**, which can be:

- **Fully managed**: Includes automatic scaling, routing, and repairs.
- **Partially managed**: Some management aspects are handled manually.

### Containers

Each service consists of one or more **containers**. Containers may vary by function or type, such as in **HA (High Availability) mode**, where a fully managed MariaDB service might have 5 containers (3 for databases, 2 for proxies).

- **Predefined Images**: Containers use Zerops' predefined images, ranging from **fully managed** (e.g., databases) to **customizable** (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **Public Accessibility**: Services can be exposed via Zerops subdomains, custom domains, or public ports on IPv6/IPv4 addresses.

**Refer to the technology section for detailed setup instructions.**
