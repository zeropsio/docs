# Project & Services Structure

Zerops structure has three levels - _projects_, _services_ and _containers_.

## Project

Project is the top-level entity, which consists of **services**. TODO max amount of projects

To function properly, a project needs its **"core"** to be running - which contains a logger service, a statistics service, HTTP routing with SSL certificates, IP routing with built-in firewall etc. It is created when the first user service is deployed and is charged a fixed monthly cost.

All services within a project share a dedicated **private network** and can access environment variables of other services.

Each project is already created with a unique **IPv6 address**, and a unique **IPv4 address** can be assigned to the project for an extra cost.

:::tip
You can create a separate project for any environment (development, stage, production) or even for each developer if you so wish. Alternatively, you can benefit from a single project shared among all developers reducing the overall cost.

## Services & Containers

A project can contain an unlimited number of services. Depending on the type of service, there are either **fully managed** (scaling, repairing, routing), or **partially managed** services.

Each service contains **one or more Linux containers**, either of identical type as a HA mode and/or of different types. E.g. a fully managed MariaDB service in HA mode consists of 5 containers - 3 database ones and 2 proxies.

Each container image is based on one of **predefined Zerops images**. Depending on the technology these images range from **fully managed** (databases) to **fully customizable** (Ubuntu).

Each runtime environment or static web server services can be made **publicly accessible** through Zerops subdomains or domains, pointing your DNS records to the IPv6 or IPv4 addresses assigned to the project, or by setting up direct access by opening public ports on the assigned IP addresses.
