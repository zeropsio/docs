description: Learn how you can work with backups in Zerops works.

Zerops provides data backup for certain services.

Whether a service supports backups is specified on the documentation page of each service. Technical details about backup implementation for each service are also described on their respective service pages.

## Supported Services and Formats

Zerops supports backups for these services with the following formats:

- **MariaDB**: `.xb.zip` (using mariabackup with xbstream format)
- **PostgreSQL**: `.dump` (using pg_dump with custom format)
- **Qdrant**: `snapshot`
- **NATS**: `.tar.gz`
- **Elasticsearch**: `.gz`
- **Meilisearch**: `.dump`
- **Shared Storage**: `.tar.gz`

## Backup File Naming

Backup files follow a consistent naming convention:
`backup-{serviceName}-{dateTime}.{extension}`

For example:
`backup-db-2024-11-04-120007.dump`

## Frequency and volume

By default, your data is backed up automatically **every day** between 00:00:00 UTC and 01:00:00 UTC, unless you update your settings.

### Managing Backups in GUI

To manage backups, go to the service detail and choose **Backups List & Configuration** section in the left menu.

#### Configure Backup Settings

From this section, you can:
- Do a one-time backup of your data
- Change the frequency of your automatic backups
- Turn off backing up your data completely

</p>

#### Backup Frequency Options

You can configure backups with several preset schedules:
- **No backups**: Disable automatic backups (not recommended)
- **Once a day**: Daily backups at the specified time
- **Once a week**: Weekly backups on the specified day and time
- **Once a month**: Monthly backups on the specified day and time
- **Custom CRON**: Define a custom schedule using CRON syntax

For the Custom CRON option, you can use the following syntax:

<table className="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th className="whitespace-nowrap w-fit">Field name</th>
      <th className="w-full">Allowed values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr className="text-left">
      <td className="w-fit">Minute</td>
      <td className="w-fit">0-59</td>
    </tr>
    <tr className="text-left">
      <td className="w-fit">Hour</td>
      <td className="w-fit">0-23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr className="text-left">
      <td className="w-fit">Day</td>
      <td className="w-fit">1-31</td>
    </tr>
    <tr className="text-left">
      <td className="w-fit">Month</td>
      <td className="w-fit">1-12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr className="text-left">
      <td className="w-fit">Week Day</td>
      <td className="w-fit">0â€“7; both 0 and 7 represent Sunday</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Examples:
- `0 2 * * *` - Every day at 2:00 AM
- `0 4 * * 0` - Every Sunday at 4:00 AM
- `0 0 1 * *` - First day of every month at midnight

#### View and Manage Backup Files

In the same section, you can:
- View all of your backups
- Download a backup
- Delete a backup

<p align="center">

    alt="List of backups"

  />
</p>

### Using CLI

You can also manage backups programmatically using the Zerops CLI:

```bash
zcli backup serviceName
```

This command triggers a backup for the specified service and waits until the backup is either completed or fails.

### Limits

- Each backup is stored for a maximum period of **1 month**
- For each **service** a maximum of **100 backups** is stored
- For each **project** a maximum of **25 GiB** of backup volume is stored. Only full backups are stored, the backup that exceeds the limit by its part is not stored

If you need more backup storage space, contact our support team.

#### Examples

1. If you backup your data every day, and the total volume is less than 25 GiB, the maximum number of backups is ~30 for the last month. A new backup is stored every day (with the oldest one being deleted), unless you exceed the 25 GiB limit.

2. If you backup your data every hour, and the total volume is less than 25 GiB, the total number of backups is 100 for the last 100 hours. A new backup is stored every hour (with the oldest one being deleted), unless you exceed the 25 GiB limit.

3. If you backup your data every hour, and your backups exceed 25 GiB after 50 hours, the total number of backups is 50, unless you delete some of your backups or wait the oldest one is older than 1 month.

## Persistence

When deleting a service or a project:
* Project deletion affects backups of **all** services within that project
* Backups remain accessible for 7 days
* After 7 days, all backups are permanently removed

## High Availability Setup

For services running in HA mode, the backup is created on one of the nodes at random. Other nodes report that the backup is running on another node.

## Encryption and Security

Backups are encrypted as soon as they are created. Here is the process:

* **Key Generation:** We use asymmetric cryptography (X25519) to generate a private key, which is then encrypted using our secret key (RSA-OAEP) and securely stored in our database.
* **Public Key Usage:** The public key is sent to the application, which uses it to encrypt the backup.
* **Decryption:** When a user downloads a backup, it is decrypted using the private key stored safely in our database.

This ensures your data remains secure during both storage and transmission.

All backups are stored in a separate ObjectStorage instance, isolated from the instance accessible by users.

After a project is deleted and the 7-day retention period expires, the project's encryption key is permanently deleted. Once this happens, there is no way to decrypt or restore the backup data.
