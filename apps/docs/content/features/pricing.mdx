## Understanding Projects

A **Zerops project** is a private network facilitating internal communication and environment variable sharing among services. You can:
- Host multiple small websites within one project.
- Create separate projects for different environments (production, development, local).

The total deployment cost includes the **core package cost** plus the **resource costs** of services within the project, along with any additional charges (e.g., Unique IPv4, Extra Egress, Object Storage).

## Project Plans

Every deployment requires a project that provides essential infrastructure. Projects manage core services like load balancing and container orchestration.

### Lightweight Plan
- **Cost:** Free
- **Best for:** Development and small-scale applications
- **Infrastructure:** Single container
- **Features:**
  - Core services (L3 balancer, logger, statistics)
  - HTTP routing & load balancers with SSL termination
  - Unique IPv6 address
  - 15 hours of build time
  - 5 GB encrypted backup space
  - 100 GB egress
- **Limitations:** Shared IPv4 address, no high availability

### Serious Plan
- **Cost:** $10 / 30 days
- **Best for:** Production and high-availability applications
- **Infrastructure:** Multi-container setup
- **Features:**
  - Highly available core services
  - Enhanced HTTP routing & load balancing with SSL termination
  - Unique IPv6 address
  - 150 hours of build time
  - 25 GB encrypted backup space
  - 3 TB egress
- **Benefits:** Automatic failover for production workloads

:::info Billing
Costs are based on actual usage. You are charged only for the time your project is active, calculated down to the minute.

### Additional Costs

Exceeding project limits incurs extra charges:

| Resource          | Cost                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Backup Space      | $0.50 per 5 GB           |
| Build Time        | $0.50 per 15 hours       |
| Egress Traffic    | $0.10 per GB             |

## Service Resources

Resources are allocated per service and billed by the minute, with hourly deductions based on actual usage.

### Resource Pricing

| Resource          | Cost                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Shared CPU        | $0.60 per CPU / 30 days   |
| Dedicated CPU     | $6.00 per CPU / 30 days   |
| RAM               | $0.75 per 0.25 GB / 30 days|
| Disk Space        | $0.05 per 0.5 GB / 30 days |

### Additional Feature Costs

Opting for extra features incurs these costs:

| Feature                    | Cost                     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Unique IPv4 Address       | $3.00 / 30 days          |
| Object Storage             | $0.01 / GB per month     |

:::info IPv4 and Cloudflare
Projects start with a shared IPv4 address. A unique IPv4 is required for Cloudflare's proxy features.
