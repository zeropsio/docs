## Understanding Projects

A Zerops project represents a private network where services can communicate internally and share environment variables. You have the flexibility to:
- Host multiple small websites within a single project
- Create separate projects for different environments (production, development, local) of a larger application

The total cost of deploying an application includes your project's **core package cost** + the **cost of the resources** of the services inside a project **(+ extra costs like Unique IPv4, Extra Egress, Object Storage, Backup Space, Build Time, etc)**.

## Project Plans

Every deployment on Zerops requires a project, which provides essential infrastructure and functionality. Projects are the foundation of your application, handling core services like load balancing, routing, and container orchestration.

### Lightweight Plan
- **Cost:** Free
- **Best for:** Development, testing, and small-scale applications
- **Infrastructure:** Single container setup
- **Features Include:**
  - Core services (L3 balancer with firewall, logger, statistics service)
  - HTTP routing & load balancers with SSL termination and automatic certificate generation
  - Proxy / load balancers for managed services
  - Unique IPv6 IP address
  - 15 hours of build time on performant build containers
  - 5 GB space for automatic, encrypted backups
  - 100 GB of egress
- **Limitations:** Shared IPv4 address, no high availability

### Serious Plan
- **Cost:** $10 / 30 days
- **Best for:** Production and high-availability applications
- **Infrastructure:** Multi-container, highly available setup
- **Features Include:**
  - Highly available core services (L3 balancer with firewall, logger, statistics service)
  - Highly available HTTP routing & load balancer with SSL termination
  - Proxy / load balancers for managed services
  - Unique IPv6 IP address
  - 150 hours of build time on performant build containers
  - 25 GB space for automatic, encrypted backups
  - 3 TB of egress
- **Benefits:** Ready for production workloads with automatic failover

:::info Billing
Project costs are calculated based on actual usage. You're only charged for the time your project is active, calculated down to the minute.

:::info IPv4 and Cloudflare
By default, projects start with a shared IPv4 address. If you plan to use Cloudflare's proxy features, you'll need to purchase a unique IPv4 address for your project.
:::

:::info Object Storage
External storage solution ideal for storing files, backups, and static assets outside your main storage. Perfect for scalable content delivery and backup strategies.
