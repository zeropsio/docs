Zerops provides multiple ways to access your services, whether you need internal communication between services, secure access from your development machine, or public access from the internet.

:::note
By default, your services are not publicly accessible until you configure external access. Internal communication between services within the same project works automatically.
:::

## How Zerops Networking Works

Every Zerops project includes a **shared networking infrastructure** that handles all access methods:

**Private Project Network:**
- All services within a project share a dedicated private network
- Services communicate directly using hostnames and internal ports
- Traffic stays isolated within your project

**Public Access Infrastructure:**
- **Core (L3) Balancer** manages IP addresses and direct port access
- **L7 HTTP Balancer** handles domain routing and SSL termination
  - Can be extensively configured for advanced routing, performance optimization, and custom behaviors
  - See the [L7 Balancer Configuration Guide](/references/networking/l7-balancer-config) for detailed options
- Both are shared across all services in your project

**Secure External Access:**
- **Built-in VPN** provides secure tunnel access to your project's private network
- Useful for development, debugging, and administration

## Internal Access

Services within the same project can communicate directly using hostnames and internal ports. No additional configuration required.

**Example:** Connect to your `api` service on port 3000:
```
http://api:3000
```

**Key points:**
- Use service hostname as the address
- Use HTTP (not HTTPS) for internal communication
- Access internal ports defined in your service configuration
- Communication is automatically isolated from other projects

### Environment Variables

Zerops automatically creates environment variables to help with internal connections between services.

## VPN Access
:::tip Complete VPN Setup
See the [VPN reference guide](/references/networking/vpn).

Connect securely to your project's internal network from your local machine:

```bash
# Connect to your project
zcli vpn up <project-id>

# Access services using internal hostnames
curl http://api:3000/health

# Disconnect when done
zcli vpn down
```

## Public Access

Make your services accessible from the internet using one of three methods:

### Zerops Subdomain
**Best for:** Development and testing

- Quick setup with automatic `.zerops.app` subdomains
- Each service gets its own unique subdomain
- Automatic SSL certificate management
- Shared infrastructure (has limitations for production use)

### Custom Domain
**Best for:** Production deployments

- Use your own domain names
- Better performance with dedicated balancer
- Full control over SSL and routing
- Requires DNS configuration

### Direct Port Access
**Best for:** Non-HTTP protocols and specialized use cases

- Direct access to specific ports on your services
- Supports any protocol (TCP/UDP)
- Optional firewall configuration
- Uses your project's IP addresses
