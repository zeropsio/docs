# Developer First Infrastructure

At Zerops, we prioritize developer experience while providing robust infrastructure capabilities that grow with your needs. Our platform is designed to support applications from simple to complex architectures, ensuring a seamless development journey from local development to production.

:::tip Key Benefits
- **Zero Infrastructure Management** - Focus on code, not on infrastructure
- **Environment Parity** - Identical behavior across all environments
- **Automated Scaling** - Resources that adapt to your needs
- **Built-in DevOps** - Integrated CI/CD, monitoring, and management tools
:::

## Project & Service Structure

Zerops organizes your infrastructure into three levels:

- **Projects** - Top-level entities containing multiple services
- **Services** - Encapsulate your containers with specific roles
- **Containers** - Individual runtime units within services

:::info Project Features
- Private network for all services
- Automatic IPv6 address allocation
- Optional IPv4 address support
- Built-in logging and statistics
- Automated HTTP routing with SSL
:::

## Adaptive Infrastructure

Our infrastructure adapts to your application's needs, whether you're running a simple website or a complex microservices architecture.

### Intelligent Scaling

Zerops provides enterprise-grade scaling that responds to your application's actual demands:

```yaml title="Example service configuration"
services:
  - hostname: app
    minContainers: 2
    maxContainers: 6
    verticalAutoscaling:
      cpuMode: DEDICATED
      minCpu: 2
      maxCpu: 5
      minRam: 2
      maxRam: 24
      minDisk: 6
      maxDisk: 50
      startCpuCoreCount: 3
      minFreeRamGB: 0.5
      minFreeRamPercent: 20
```

- **Vertical Scaling** - Automatic CPU and RAM adjustment
- **Horizontal Scaling** - Dynamic container count management
- **Cost Optimization** - Pay only for resources you actually use
- **Dynamic Storage** - Automated disk space management

### High Availability Mode

Every service can run in HA mode with automatic failover:

```yaml title="Example HA configuration"
services:
  - hostname: db
    type: postgresql@16
    mode: NON_HA  # Non-HA mode

  - hostname: cache
    type: valkey@7.2
    mode: HA  # High availability mode
```

- **Multi-Zone Distribution** - Services run across multiple availability zones
- **Automated Failover** - Self-healing infrastructure
- **Data Replication** - Automatic synchronization
- **Load Distribution** - Enhanced performance through balancing

## Developer Experience & Tooling

### Zero-Config Build Pipeline

Add a `zerops.yml` to your repository root. Here are common deployment patterns:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="monorepo" label="Monorepo Multiple Apps">
  ```yaml title="zerops.yml"
      run:
        base: nodejs@20
        ports:
          - port: 3000
            httpSupport: true
          - port: 3001
            httpSupport: true
        startCommands:
          - command: pnpm run start:web
            name: web
          - command: pnpm run start:docs
            name: docs
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="standard" label="Single Application">
  ```yaml title="zerops.yml"
      run:
        base: nodejs@20
        ports:
          - port: 3000
            httpSupport: true
        start: npm start
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip Multiple Start Commands
For monorepo deployments, use `startCommands` to run multiple applications in a single service:
- Each command can have a unique name for better monitoring
- Configure multiple ports with `httpSupport` for web access
- Use a shared build process for better resource utilization
:::

### Native Service Discovery

Services within your project communicate seamlessly using internal hostnames:

```env
DB_HOST: ${db_hostname}
REDIS_HOST: ${redis_hostname}
```

Environment variables are automatically injected and synchronized across all containers.

### Built-in Observability

Comprehensive monitoring and logging with zero configuration:

- **Metrics Dashboard** - Real-time performance monitoring
- **Log Aggregation** - Centralized logging with search
- **Alert Management** - Customizable notifications
- **Service Health** - Automatic status monitoring

### Development Tools

Complete toolkit for modern development:

- **CLI Tools** - Powerful command-line interface
- **API Access** - RESTful API for automation
- **Service Templates** - Pre-configured definitions
- **Environment Management** - Secure variable handling
