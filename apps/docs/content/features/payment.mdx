Zerops provides a transparent credit-based payment system that makes managing your account finances straightforward. You can easily add funds to your account through manual or automatic top-ups, track all your transactions, and download invoices for your records.

This page explains how to manage your account balance, set up payment preferences, and access your complete billing history to help you maintain uninterrupted service while keeping your finances organized.

## Manual Top-up

Manual top-ups give you direct control over your account funding. To add credits to your account immediately:

1. Navigate to **Credit & Spend Overview** in the Organization section of the main menu
2. Click on **Top up credit** and fill in the [billing information](#billing-information)
3. Enter your desired top-up amount (minimum $10 VAT excl.)
3. Complete payment using your saved or new payment method

## Automatic Top-ups

:::caution Beta version
Available only for customers who have previously made a manual top-up, have a saved payment method, and have provided billing information.
:::

Automatic top-up ensures your projects continue running without interruption by replenishing your credits when they run low.

### How Automatic Top-ups Work

When enabled, Zerops monitors your credit balance and consumption rate to determine when and how much to top up, always respecting your configured limits.
Zerops initiates an automatic payment when:

- Your remaining credits are sufficient for **less than 10 days** of operation at your **current consumption rate**
- You have automatic top-ups enabled
- Your [settings](#billing-information) allow for the payment amount

:::note Important notes
- The charge amount is estimated based on your actual usage patterns, not maximum possible amounts
- Negative balances are included in the next auto top-up (within your maximum charge limit)
- The system checks your balance immediately after enabling auto top-ups, potentially triggering an immediate payment
- Auto top-up limits don't affect manual payments â€” add any amount manually regardless of automatic settings
:::

### Configuration Options

#### Period
The timeframe for which the maximum configured auto-charge amount is checked. Can be set to either:

- **Weekly**: Maximum charge amount applies to a 7-day rolling window
- **Monthly**: Maximum charge amount applies to a 30-day rolling window

#### Maximum Charge Amount
The maximum amount that can be auto-charged in the given period. This serves as a safeguard against unexpected costs due to traffic spikes or other unforeseen circumstances.

- Minimum setting: $10 (matches the minimum manual payment)

<Dropdown>
<DropdownItem title="Real-World Example">
**Scenario:** Application with $20 weekly operating costs and initial manual top-up of $100

**Your Settings:**
- Period = Weekly
- Maximum charge amount = $150

**Expected behavior:**
- System adds approximately $20-30 when less than 10 days of credits remain (around day 35)
- Payments continue in small increments aligned with your usage patterns
- During traffic spikes, payments adjust to match higher consumption (up to $150 weekly limit)
- Payment amounts return to normal when usage decreases
