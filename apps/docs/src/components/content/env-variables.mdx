Environment variables help you run your application in different environments. They allow you to isolate all specific environment aspects from your application code and keep your app encapsulated.

In Zerops you do not have to create a `.env` file manually. Zerops handles the environment variables for you.

## Types of env variables in Zerops

There are 3 different sets of env variables in Zerops:

<table className="w-fit my-1.5">
  <thead>
    <tr className="text-center  rounded-lg">
      <th className="w-fit"><strong>Type</strong></th>
      <th className="w-fit"><strong>Environment</strong></th>
      <th className="w-fit"><strong>Defined in</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr className="text-center">
      <td className="w-fit">basic</td>
      <td className="w-fit">build</td>
      <td className="w-fit"><VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/build-pipeline#envvariables">zerops.yaml</VarLink></td>
    </tr>
    <tr className="text-center">
      <td className="w-fit">basic</td>
      <td className="w-fit">runtime</td>
      <td className="w-fit"><VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/build-pipeline#envvariables-1">zerops.yaml</VarLink></td>
    </tr>
    <tr className="text-center">
      <td className="w-fit">secret</td>
      <td className="w-fit">runtime</td>
      <td className="w-fit"><VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/env-variables#set-secret-env-variables-in-zerops-gui">Zerops GUI</VarLink></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Use the <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/create#set-secret-environment-variables">secret env variables</VarLink> for all sensitive data you don't want to store in your application code. Secret env variables are also useful if you need for testing where you need to change the value of some env variables frequently. Secret variables are managed in Zerops GUI and you don't have to redeploy your application.

The basic build and runtime env variables are listed in your [zerops.yaml](/zerops-yaml/specification) and deployed together with your application code. When you need to update a value of an existing env variable or change the set of build or runtime env variables, update your zerops.yaml and redeploy your application to Zerops.

You can <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/env-variables#reference-a-local-variable-in-another-variable-value">reference</VarLink> another variable of the same service or even a variable of <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/env-variables#reference-a-variable-of-another-project-service">another service</VarLink> within the same project.

## Set secret env variables in Zerops GUI

Use secret variables to store passwords, tokens and other sensitive information that shouldn't be part of your repository and listed in zerops.yaml.

    src="/img/screenshots/secret_env.png"
    alt="image"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
  />
</p>

You can set env variables when you <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/create">create</VarLink> a new <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service or you can set them later.

To configure env variables for an existing service, go to the service detail and choose **Environment variables** in the left menu. Scroll to the **Secret variables** section and click on the **Add secret variable** button and set variable key and value.

You can edit or delete env variables that you've created by clicking on the menu on the right side of each row.

The changes you've made to environment variables will be automatically applied to all containers of your project's services.

:::caution
You need to **restart** the runtime service after you update environment variables. The <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> process running in the container receives the list env variables only when it starts. Update of the env variables while the <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> process is running does not affect your application.
:::

## Set basic build env variables in zerops.yaml

To set basic env variables for the build environment, add the `envVariables` attribute to the build section in your `zerops.yaml`

```yaml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    build:
       …

      # OPTIONAL. Defines the env variables for the build environment:
      envVariables:
        DB_NAME: db
        DB_HOST: db
        DB_USER: db
        DB_PASS: ${db_password}
```

When you need to update a value of an existing env variable or change the set of build or runtime env variables, update your `zerops.yaml` and redeploy your application to Zerops.

## Set basic runtime env variables in zerops.yaml

To set basic env variables for the runtime environment, add the `envVariables` attribute to the runtime section in your `zerops.yaml`.

```yaml
zerops:
  # define hostname of your service
  - setup: app
    # ==== how to build your application ====
    run:
       …

      # OPTIONAL. Defines the env variables for the runtime environment:
      envVariables:
        DB_NAME: db
        DB_HOST: db
        DB_USER: db
        DB_PASS: ${db_password}
```

When you need to update a value of an existing env variable or change the set of build or runtime env variables, update your `zerops.yaml` and redeploy your application to Zerops.

## Env variable restrictions

**key**

- must satisfy the following regular expression: `[a-zA-Z_]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*`
- all variable keys in the same service must be unique regardless of case
- keys are case sensitive

**value**

- must contain only ASCII characters
- the _End of Line_ character is forbidden

These restrictions apply to all <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/env-variables#types-of-env-variables-in-zerops">types of env variables</VarLink>.

## Referencing other env variables

You can reference another variable of the same service using `${key}` in your variable value. You can even reference a variable from a different service using `${hostname_key}`. The referenced variable doesn't need to exist when you are entering your variable.

### Reference a local variable in another variable value

<table className="w-fit my-1.5">
  <thead>
    <tr className="text-center rounded-lg">
      <th className="w-fit"><strong>Variable key</strong></th>
      <th className="w-fit"><strong>Variable value</strong></th>
      <th className="w-fit"><strong>Computed variable value</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit font-semibold">id</td>
      <td className="w-fit">12345</td>
      <td className="w-fit">12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit font-semibold">hostname</td>
      <td className="w-fit">app</td>
      <td className="w-fit">app</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit font-semibold">name</td>
      <td className="w-fit">`${id}-${hostname}`</td>
      <td className="w-fit">12345-app</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
### Reference a variable of another project service

Let's say your project contains two PostgreSQL services `dbtest` and `dbprod`. Both services have a `connectionString` variable. Then you can create a `dbConnectionString` env variable in your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> runtime and set `${dbtest_connectionString}` as the variable value. Zerops will fill in the value of the `connectionString` variable of the `dbtest` service.

When you change the `dbConnectionString` value to `${dbprod_connectionString}`, Zerops will fill in the value of the `connectionString` variable of the `dbprod` service.

:::caution
When you change the value of the `connectionString` variable in the service `dbtest` you need to **restart** the <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service. The <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> process running in the container receives the list env variables only when it starts. Update of the env variables while the <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> process is running does not affect your application.
:::

## Generated env variables

Zerops creates several helper variables when a <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service is created, e.g. `hostname`, `PATH`. Some helper variables are read-only (`hostname`), others are editable (`PATH`). Generated variables cannot be deleted.

Generated env variables are listed on the **Environment variables** page. Scroll to the **Generated variables** section.

</p>

## How to read env variables from your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> app

Zerops passes all environment variables from all project services when your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> app is deployed and started.

To access the local environment variable i.e. the variable set to this <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service in your app, use:

<VarCodeBlock codeVar="codeExample" languageVar="codeLanguage" />

## How to read env variables of another service

All services of the same project can reference environment variables from other services. To use an environment variable from one service in another service in the same project, you must prefix the environment variable key with the service hostname and underscore.

#### Examples:

To access the `connectionString` env variable of the `mariadb1` service, use `mariadb1_connectionString` as the env variable key.
To access the `password` env variable of the `mariadb2` service, use `mariadb2_password` as the env variable key.

## How to read runtime env variables in the build environment

You can use runtime env variables in the build environment using the `RUNTIME_` prefix. For example if you have a runtime variable with the `connectionString` key, use the `RUNTIME_connectionString` to read the variable in the build environment. This rule applies both for basic and secret runtime variables.

## Basic and secret env variable with the same key

If you create a secret env variable and a basic runtime env variable with the same key, Zerops saves the basic runtime env variable from your zerops.yaml and ignores the secret env variable.

If you create a basic build env variable and a runtime env variable with the same key, Zerops saves both because the build and runtime environments have separate sets of env variables.
