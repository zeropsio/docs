### Configure auto scaling

Zerops automatically scales <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> services both vertically and horizontally. Configure the scaling parameters to match your application's needs and control costs.

#### Quick Configuration

**CPU Mode**: Choose between shared (cost-effective) or dedicated (consistent performance).

**Resource Limits**: Set minimum and maximum resources for CPU, RAM, and disk to control costs and ensure performance.

**Advanced Resource Settings**: Beyond the basic limits, Zerops provides additional scaling parameters for fine-tuning performance:

- **Start CPU cores** - Allocate extra CPU power during application startup
- **RAM thresholds** - Prevent out-of-memory crashes with custom buffer settings
- **CPU scaling thresholds** (dedicated mode) - Control when scaling is triggered

These settings can significantly improve application performance and reliability. See the scaling guides below for detailed configuration options.

**Container Limits**: Configure horizontal scaling from 1 to 10 containers.

- **Single container** (max = 1): Cost-effective for development, but no high availability
- **Multiple containers** (max > 1): High availability for production, requires stateless application design
