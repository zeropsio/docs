Zerops provides [shared storage service](/shared-storage/overview) that can be connected to runtime services. Shared storage enables your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service to share files between all containers of the same service or even among containers of different runtime services.

## Connect shared storage in Zerops GUI

### When creating new shared storage

Connect your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service directly when creating a new shared storage service. Select your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service in the **Share with Services** block on the **Add new shared storage service** page.

### Connect existing shared storage

To connect existing shared storage to your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service:

1. Go to the shared storage service detail page
2. Select **Shared storage connections**
3. Choose your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service from the list of runtime services
4. The shared storage will be connected to your service

### How it works

Zerops creates a new folder `/mnt/[shared storage name]` in your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service's root directory. For example, `/mnt/teststorage` for a `teststorage` shared storage.

The content of this folder is shared among:
- All containers of your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service
- All containers of other connected runtime services (if you connect multiple services)

## Disconnect shared storage

To disconnect shared storage from your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service:

1. Go to the shared storage service detail page
2. Select **Shared storage connections**
3. Switch off the toggle next to your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service

## Create <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service with shared storage using zCLI

zCLI is the Zerops command-line tool. To create a new <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service with shared storage via command-line:

1. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli)
2. [Create a project description file](#create-project-description-file)
3. [Create the project](#create-project-with-shared-storage)

### Create project description file

Zerops uses YAML format to describe project infrastructure. <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/create#create-a-project-description-file">Read the basics</VarLink> about defining <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> services in `description.yaml`.

#### Example with shared storage

Create a directory `my-project` and add a `description.yaml` file:

<VarCodeBlock codeVar="yamlCode" languageVar="yamlLang" />

The `mount` attribute accepts an array of shared storage names to mount to your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service.

### Create project with shared storage

Follow the guide <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/create#create-a-project-based-on-the-descriptionyaml">how to create a project based on description.yaml</VarLink> to deploy your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service with shared storage.
