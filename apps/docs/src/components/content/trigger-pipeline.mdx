## Automatic builds and deploys from GitHub or GitLab

Integrate Zerops to your GitHub or GitLab repository and configure the automatic builds and deploys.

Follow these steps:

1. Add <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/build-pipeline#add-zeropsyaml-to-your-repository">zerops.yaml</VarLink> to your repository.
2. Connect your GitHub repository or connect your GitLab repository

Then each time you create a new tag or push to a specific branch, depending on the configuration, GitHub or GitLab will initiate a new build & deploy pipeline.

<p align="center">
  <Image
    lightImage="/img/gui/github-integration.webp"
    darkImage="/img/gui/github-integration.webp"
    alt="github integration"
    style={{ width: '95%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</p>

:::info
You can change the build and deploy pipeline when you need to. Just simply modify the `zerops.yaml` in your repository.
:::

### Skip the automatic pipeline once

To ensure that a pipeline is not triggered by your next push, add `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` to the commit message. It is case insensitive.

:::note
You will still see a successful delivery of a webhook in your Github/Gitlab repository as a webhook is actually triggered, but with no action.

## Manual builds and deploys using Zerops CLI

<p align="center">

    darkImage="/img/mind-maps/build-deploy/manual-deploy.webp"
    alt="Manual Deploy Pipeline"
    style={{ width: '95%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</p>

To start a new build & deploy pipeline manually, use the Zerops CLI.

Follow these steps:

1. Add <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/build-pipeline#add-zeropsyaml-to-your-repository">`zerops.yaml`</VarLink> to your repository.
2. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli) the Zerops command line tool.
3. Run `zcli push` command.

The `zcli push` command uploads your application code, builds and deploys your application in Zerops.

The command triggers the <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/trigger-pipeline">build pipeline</VarLink> defined in `zerops.yaml`. `zerops.yaml` must be in the working directory. The working directory is by default the current directory and can be changed using the <br/>`--working-dir` flag.

zCLI uploads all files and subdirectories of the working directory to Zerops and starts the build pipeline. If the `.gitignore` file is found, it is interpreted and the defined files and folders will be ignored.

If you just want to deploy your application to Zerops, use the [zcli deploy](#manual-deploy-using-zerops-cli) command instead.

#### Push command parameters

```sh
Usage:
  zcli push [service-id-or-name] [flags]

Flags:
      --archive-file-path string   If set, zCLI creates a tar.gz archive with the application code in the required path relative
                                   to the working directory. By default, no archive is created.
  -g, --deploy-git-folder          If set, zCLI the .git folder is also uploaded. By default, the .git folder is ignored.
      --disable-logs               disable logs
  -h, --help                       Help for the service push command.
      --no-git                     If set, entire content of the working dir is uploaded as is.
                                   Can not be combined with --workspace-state or --deploy-git-folder flags.
  -P, --project-id string          If you have access to more than one project, you must specify the project ID for which the
                                   command is to be executed.
  -S, --service-id string          If you have access to more than one service, you must specify the service ID for which the
                                   command is to be executed.
      --setup string               Choose setup to be used from zerops.yml.
  -v, --verbose                    If set, additional data will be logged to the zcli debug log file.
      --version-name string        Adds a custom version name. Automatically filled if the ZEROPS_VERSIONNAME environment variable exists.
      --working-dir string         Sets a custom working directory. Default working directory is the current directory. (default "./")
  -w, --workspace-state string     Defines version of the workspace to be pushed:
                                   clean - pushes the HEAD without any local changes
                                   staged - pushes only staged files
                                   all - pushes all staged and unstaged files (default "all")
      --zerops-yaml-path string    Sets a custom path to the zerops.yml file relative to the working directory. By default zCLI
                                   looks for zerops.yml in the working directory.
```

zCLI commands are interactive, when you press enter after `zcli push`, you will be given a list of your projects to choose from.

## Manual deploy using Zerops CLI

To start only a deploy pipeline, use the Zerops CLI.

Follow these steps:

1. Add <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/build-pipeline#add-zeropsyaml-to-your-repository">zerops.yaml</VarLink> to your repository. Omit the build section.
2. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli) the Zerops command line tool.
3. Run `zcli service deploy` command.

The `zcli service deploy` command uploads your application and deploys it in Zerops. Use this tool if you have your own build process. If you want to build your application in Zerops, use an [automatic](#automatic-builds-and-deploys-from-github-or-gitlab) or [manual](#manual-builds-and-deploys-using-zerops-cli) build process.

#### Deploy command parameters

```sh
Usage:
  zcli service deploy pathToFileOrDir [flags]

Flags:
      --archive-file-path string   If set, zCLI creates a tar.gz archive with the application code in the required path relative
                                   to the working directory. By default, no archive is created.
  -g, --deploy-git-folder          If set, zCLI the .git folder is also uploaded. By default, the .git folder is ignored.
  -h, --help                       Help for the service deploy command.
  -P, --project-id string          If you have access to more than one project, you must specify the project ID for which the
                                   command is to be executed.
  -S, --service-id string          If you have access to more than one service, you must specify the service ID for which the
                                   command is to be executed.
      --setup string               Choose setup to be used from zerops.yml.
  -v, --verbose                    If set, additional data will be logged to the zcli debug log file.
      --version-name string        Adds a custom version name. Automatically filled if the ZEROPS_VERSIONNAME environment variable exists.
      --working-dir string         Sets a custom working directory. Default working directory is the current directory. (default "./")
      --zerops-yaml-path string    Sets a custom path to the zerops.yml file relative to the working directory. By default zCLI
                                   looks for zerops.yml in the working directory.
```

`pathToFileOrDir` defines a path to one or more directories and/or files relative to the working directory. The working directory is by default the current directory and can be changed using the <br/>`--working-dir` flag.

`zerops.yaml` must be placed in the working directory.
