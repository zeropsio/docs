## Beyond basic logging

Zerops offers additional observability options to help you monitor and debug your application:

### Log Forwarding
Forward logs to [external services](/references/log-forwarding) for advanced analysis and long-term storage, including Better Stack, Papertrail, self-hosted ELK stack with Logstash, or any syslog-ng compatible software.

### Full Observability Stack
Deploy [self-hosted observability solutions](/references/metrics) for comprehensive monitoring with ELK Stack (centralized logging with Kibana + application tracing with APM) or Prometheus & Grafana (metrics collection, visualization, and custom dashboards).
