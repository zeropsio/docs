Zerops provides 3 different logs for your <Var name="servicePath" /> service:

- [Build log](#build-log) - Output from your build process
- [Prepare runtime log](#prepare-runtime-log) - Custom runtime image creation
- [Runtime log](#runtime-log) - Operational output from your running service

For comprehensive logging features including project-wide log views, filtering options, and log forwarding to external services, see the [Logging & Log Forwarding](/references/logging) documentation.
