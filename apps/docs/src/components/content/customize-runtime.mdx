## Build Custom Runtime Images

Zerops allows you to build custom runtime images (CRI) when the default base runtime images don't meet your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> application's requirements. This is an optional phase in the [build and deploy pipeline](/features/pipeline#runtime-prepare-phase-optional).

## Configuration

### Default <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> Runtime Environment

The default <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> runtime environment contains:

- <span>{data.alpine.default}</span>
- Selected version of <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> when the runtime service was created
- [zCLI](/references/cli)
- <Var name="defaultEnvironment" />

### When You Need a Custom Runtime Image

If your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> application needs more than what's included in the default environment, you'll need to build a custom runtime image. Common scenarios include:

<VarReasons name="customReasons" />

:::important
You should not include your application code in the custom runtime image, as your built/packaged code is deployed automatically into fresh containers.
:::

Here are <Var name="serviceDisplay" />-specific examples of configuring custom runtime images in your `zerops.yml`:

### Basic <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> Setup

<VarCodeBlock codeVar="basicSetupCode" languageVar="codeLanguage" />

### Using Build Files in Runtime Preparation

<VarCodeBlock codeVar="buildFilesCode" languageVar="codeLanguage" />

For complete configuration details, see the [runtime prepare phase configuration guide](/features/pipeline#configuration).

## Process and Caching

### How Runtime Prepare Works
The runtime prepare process follows the same steps for all runtimes. See [how runtime prepare works](/features/pipeline#how-it-works) for the complete process details.

### Caching Behavior
Zerops caches custom runtime images to optimize deployment times. Learn about [custom runtime image caching](/features/pipeline#custom-runtime-image-caching) including when images are cached and reused.

### Build Management
For information about managing builds and deployments, see [managing builds and deployments](/features/pipeline#manage-builds-and-deployments).

:::warning
Shared storage mounts are not available during the runtime prepare phase.

## Troubleshooting

If your `prepareCommands` fail, check the <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/logs#prepare-runtime-log">prepare runtime log</VarLink> for specific error messages.
