Zerops automatically scales your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service based on actual usage. When your application needs more power, resources increase. When demand drops, resources scale down to reduce costs.

## How it works

**Vertical scaling** adds more CPU, RAM, or disk space to existing containers. This approach is tried first because it's faster and more efficient.

**Horizontal scaling** creates entirely new containers when vertical scaling reaches its configured limits.

## Configure scaling

You can configure scaling settings at different stages:

- **During service creation** - Set initial scaling parameters when <VarLink name="servicePath" path="/{{VAR}}/how-to/create">creating</VarLink> your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service in the Zerops GUI.

- **During import** - Define scaling configuration in your YAML import file using the `verticalAutoscaling` and horizontal scaling parameters. See [Import & Export YAML Configuration](/references/import) for complete syntax.

- **After service creation** - Navigate to your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service and select **Automatic scaling configuration** from the menu to modify settings.

### Basic settings

<p align="center">
  <Image
    lightImage="/img/gui/automatic-scaling.webp"
    darkImage="/img/gui/automatic-scaling.webp"
    alt="Automatic Scaling"
    style={{ width: '95%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</p>

**CPU mode**: Choose between shared (cost-effective, variable performance) or dedicated (consistent performance, higher cost). You can change CPU mode once per hour. See [pricing](https://zerops.io/#pricing) for costs or read more about [CPU options](/features/scaling-ha#cpu-options).

**Resource limits**: Configure minimum and maximum resources for your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service:

<ResourceTable />

- **Lower the maximum** to control costs and prevent over-scaling
- **Raise the minimum** when you need guaranteed baseline performance
- **Set minimum = maximum** to disable automatic scaling for that specific resource

**Container limits**: Set how many containers your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> service can scale to:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit my-1.5 font-semibold whitespace-nowrap">Minimum containers</td>
      <td className="w-fit my-1.5">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="w-fit my-1.5 font-semibold whitespace-nowrap">Maximum containers</td>
      <td className="w-fit my-1.5">10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Single container** (maximum = 1): More cost-effective, but your application will experience downtime if the container fails. This mode is suitable for development and testing environments.

**Multiple containers** (maximum > 1): Can provide high availability for production environments, but only if your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> application is properly designed for it. Each container runs on a different physical server for redundancy. Your application must be stateless and avoid storing data in local files to work properly across multiple containers.

### Advanced settings

**Start CPU cores**: Determines how many CPU cores are allocated during application startup. Increase this value if your <Var name="serviceDisplay" /> application starts slowly or requires more processing power during initialization.

For dedicated CPU mode, you can also configure:
- **Min free CPU %**: Triggers scaling when free CPU drops below this percentage of a single core
- **Dynamic free total %**: Triggers scaling when total free CPU across all cores drops below this percentage

:::

**RAM thresholds**: Help prevent out-of-memory crashes by maintaining buffer space:

- **Absolute (GB)**: Maintains this amount of free RAM at all times
- **Percentage**: Keeps this percentage of total RAM free

Consider increasing these values if your application experiences memory-related crashes.

## Monitor usage

Navigate to your service and select **Service dashboard & runtime containers** to view:
- CPU, RAM, and disk usage over time
- Number of active containers
- Historical scaling events

## Common issues

**Out of memory crashes**
- Increase the minimum free RAM settings in your scaling configuration
- Review your code for potential memory leaks

**Higher than expected costs**
- Consider lowering your maximum resource limits

**Application issues with multiple containers**
- Remove dependencies on local file storage (use external storage services instead)
- Implement session management that works across containers (consider using Redis or external session stores)
- Ensure your application is designed to be stateless

**Slow application startup**
- Increase the "Start CPU cores" setting in your scaling configuration
- Consider switching to dedicated CPU mode for more consistent performance
